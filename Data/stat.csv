The present study focused on updating existing estimates of the riverine nutrient contributions and on improving the favailable information on temporal and spatial variation in such input. The results show that the gulf received an average of 113,300 tons of nitrogen, 2050 tons of phosphorus and 64,900 tons of dissolved silica (DSi) annually during the time period 1977-1995. There was large interannual variation in loads, e.g., a factor two difference was found between the two most extreme years (1984 and 1990), this was attributed mainly to natural variation in water discharge. The seasonal distribution of nutrient loads exhibited a distinct pattern for practically all studied constituents, especially nitrate. Loads were high during the spring-flow and relatively low during the low-flow summer period. Examination of the spatial variation of nutrient loads showed that the Daugava River alone accounted for approximately 60% of the total riverine load. The highest area-specific loads of nitrate and phosphate were observed in the agriculturally dominated Lielupe River, and the highest loads of organic-nitrogen (org-N) and total phophorus (tot-P) were found in the Parnu River. However, the values for all the studied rivers and constituents were rather low (phosphorus) or moderate (nitrogen and silica) compared to those reported for many other drainage areas of the Baltic Sea. This was true despite the inefficient sewage treatment and intensive agriculture in the studied basins in the 1970s and 1980s. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

We concluded that there is a significant natural background level of TCA and DBA in precipitation based on the following: (i) several of samples represented snow accumulated in the 19th century, (ii) haloacetates can be expected to be immobile in Antarctic firn, (iii) extensive measures were taken to prevent sample contamination, and (iv) blank levels of the analytical procedure used were low and stable.

The purpose of this study was to analyse variations in specific leaching rates (kg ha-1 per year) and gross load (Mg per year) of N from arable land to watercourses in Sweden from a historical perspective. The start of the study was set to 1865 because information on crop distribution, yield and livestock has been compiled yearly since then. The SOIL/SOILN model was used to calculate nitrogen leaching. Calculations were done for cereals, grass and bare fallow for three different soil types in nine agricultural regions covering a range of climatic conditions. Results indicate that both specific leaching rates and gross load of nitrogen in the middle of 19th century were approximately the same as they are today for the whole of south and central Sweden. Three main explanations for this were (1) large areas of bare fallow typical for the farming practice at the time, (2) enhanced mineralisation from newly cultivated land, and (3) low yield. From 1865, i.e. the start of the calculations, N leaching rates decreased and were at their lowest around 1930. During the same period, gross load was also at its lowest despite the fact that the acreage of arable land was at its most extensive. After 1930, average leaching increased by 60% and gross load by 30%, both reaching a peak in the mid-1970s to be followed by a declining trend. The greatest increase in leaching was in regions where the increase in animal density was largest and these regions were also those where the natural conditions for leaching such as mild winters and coarse-textured soils were found. Extensive draining projects occurred during the period of investigation, in particular an intensive exploitation of lakes and wetlands. This caused a substantial drop in nitrogen retention and the probable increase in net load to the sea might thus have been more affected by this decrease in retention than the actual increase in gross load.

The appearance of strongly elevated concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in major European rivers was found to be primarily a post-war phenomenon. However, the relatively rapid water quality response to increased point source emissions and intensified agriculture does not imply that the reaction to decreased emissions will be equally rapid. Long-term fertilisation experiments have shown that important processes in the large-scale turnover of nitrogen operate on a time scale of decades up to at least a century, and in several major Eastern European rivers there is a remarkable lack of response to the dramatic decrease in the use of commercial fertilisers that started in the late 1980s. In Western Europe, studies of decreased phosphorus emissions have shown that riverine loads of this element can be rapidly reduced from high to moderate levels, whereas a further reduction, if achieved at all, may take decades. Together, the reviewed studies showed that the inertia of the systems that control the loss of nutrients from land to sea was underestimated when the present goal of a 50% reduction of the input of nutrients to the Baltic Sea and the North Sea was adopted.

We examine the performance of partial Mann–Kendall (PMK) tests, i.e. trend tests in which the critical region is determined by the conditional distribution of one Mann-Kendall (MK) statistic for monotone trend, given a set of other MK statistics. In particular, we examine the impact of incorporating information regarding covariates in the Hirsch–Slack test for trends in serially correlated data collected over several seasons. Monte Carlo simulation of the performance of PMK tests demonstrates that the gain in power due to incorporation of relevant covariates can be large compared to the loss in power caused by irrelevant covariates. Furthermore, we have found that the asymptotic normality of the test statistics in such tests enables rapid and reliable determination of critical regions, unless the sample size is very small (<em>n</em> &lt; 10) or the different MK statistics are very strongly correlated. A case study of water quality trends shows that PMK tests can detect and correct for rather complex relationships between river water quality and water discharge. The generic character of the PMK tests makes them particularly useful for scanning large sets of data for temporal trends.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2009-10-11","2009-10-11","2017-12-13","","","2","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-22755","","","","","false","","",""

Hence, the water quality at given site can exhibit a large temporal variation that makes it difficult to extract anthropogenic signals from collected data. In this paper, we examine how the human impact on nutrient concentrations in such water bodies can be clarified by replacing conventional time series or geostatistical approaches by trend detection techniques in which we analyse the variation in nutrient concentrations with salinity and time. The general principles for the trend detection are illustrated with data from the Baltic Sea. The statistical significance of temporal changes in nutrient concentrations can be assessed by using parametric and nonparametric trend tests. In the recent past a nonparametric trend test with correction for covariates was proposed (Libiseller and Grimvall, 2002). This test, however, can best be applied if trends are monotone in time, which is not necessarily fulfilled for the original data. We therefore suggest that an overall trend test is computed as the weighted sum of trend test statistics computed for different salinity levels. By this means we receive a rather homogeneous time series in each subset, which considerably improves the power of the trend test. In the parametric approach we suggest a regression model, with Total Phosphorus concentration as the dependent variable and time (months) as the explaining variable. The residuals from this model output are most likely non-independent and non-normally distributed, and we will therefore apply bootstrap assessment of the estimated parameters.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2009-10-09","2009-10-09","2010-09-28","","","2","","deprecated","","publishedPaper","","","","false","","",""

However, small gradual changes in such variables can easily be concealed by large fluctuations caused by prevailing weather conditions. Hence, there is a real need for procedures that facilitate separation of such natural variation from anthropogenic effects.</p><p>Taking meteorological or hydrological variables into consideration in a trend analysis can be done in several ways. The technique chosen to accomplish this objective depends on characteristics of the data set, for example the length of the time series and sampling frequencies, and the kind of relationships that exist between the response variable and the covariates. Two different approaches were examined in the studies underlying this thesis: multivariate non-parametric tests and parametric normalisation procedures. The non-parametric trend test proposed here was newly desinged, thus it was also necessary to conduct simulation studies to examine the performance of this method. By comparison, normalisation techniques have been used over the past few decades mainly to adjust for the impact of meteorological effects on air quality data. The choice of explanatory variables for such procedures was studied: first by examining variable selection procedures based on cross-validation, paying special attention to serially correlated response data; and secondly by considering variables derived from complex physics-based models as alternatives to measured variables. A number of other aspects that might influence the ability to detect trends were also explored, including level shifts due to instrument malfunctions.</p>","","","","","","","","","","Sal Key 1, Keyhuset, Linköpings universitet, Linköping","swe","2003-04-25T10:15","2009-10-07","2009-10-07","2012-12-14","","","1","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

So far, almost all attempts to construct DSSs for environmental management have focused on assessing the impact of a set of actions on the environment. Here, we describe the generic structure of a DSS that enables more complete evaluation of regional or national policies to reduce nitrogen inputs to water. In particular, we expound the principles for linking models of farm economic behavior to catchment-scale models of the transport and transformation of nitrogen in soil and water. First, we define system boundaries for nitrogen fluxes through the agricultural sector and the ambient environment to create a basis for model integration. Thereafter, we show how different modules operating on different temporal and spatial scales can be interlinked. Finally, we demonstrate how statistical emulators or meta-models can be derived to reduce the computational burden and increase the transparency of the DSS. In particular, we show when and how the temporal or spatial resolution of model inputs can be reduced without significantly influencing the estimates of annual nitrogen fluxes on a catchment scale.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2009-10-07","2009-10-07","2017-12-13","","","4","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

We showed that the currently used procedures to select normalisation models can cause over-fitting to observed data and undesirable smoothing of anthropogenic signals. A simulation study revealed that the risk of such effects is particularly large when: (i) the observed data are serially correlated, (ii) the normalisation model is selected by leave-one-out cross-validation, and (iii) complex models, such as artificial neural networks, are fitted to data. When the size of the test sets used in the cross-validation was increased, and only moderately complex linear models were fitted to data, the over-fitting was less pronounced. An empirical study of the predictive ability of different normalisation models for tropospheric ozone in Finland confirmed the importance of using appropriate model selection strategies. Moderately complex regional models involving contemporaneous meteorological data from a network of stations were found to be superior to single-site models as well as more complex regional models involving both contemporaneous and time-lagged meteorological data from a network of stations.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2009-10-07","2009-10-07","2017-12-13","","","2","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-22755","","","","","false","","",""

We considered the total flow of nitrate from a given area and investigated when and how hidden linear structures can be extracted from the underlying model. The presence of such structures can justify the use of spatially aggregated inputs to compute spatially aggregated outputs. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations showed that some linear structures emerged when the outputs for a long period of time were summed. Other linear structures appeared as relationships between two different components of the model outputs. However, different cropping systems respond differently to changes in anthropogenic or meteorological forcings. Therefore, we derived a reduced model of long-term leaching of nitrogen from the root zone in an agricultural area by combining each combination of soil type and cropping system. Reduced models can help make process-oriented models more transparent, and they are particularly suitable for incorporation into decision support systems.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2009-10-07","2009-10-07","2017-12-13","","","2","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

The import of mineral fertilisers and feed stuff became almost non-existent, and extensive slaughtering of livestock reduced the amount of manure. In Latvia, the purchase of mineral fertilisers decreased by a factor of 15 between 1987 and 1996 and the number of livestock decreased with a factor of almost 4 during the same time period. Such abrupt and comprehensive changes in land use have never before occurred in the history of modern European agriculture. Here, the impact that this dramatic reduction has had on concentrations of nutrients in Latvian rivers is examined. To discern temporal changes, statistical analyses were undertaken on time series of nutrient concentrations and relationships between concentrations and runoff at 12 sampling sites in ten Latvian rivers covering drainage areas from 334 to 64,000 km2. Considering the study period 1987-1998, only four of the 12 sites showed statistically significant downward trends (one-sided test at the 5% level) in the dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN = NO3-N + NO2-N + NH4-N) data. There are probably two main explanations for the weak DIN trends. Firstly, long water-transit times in the soilwater and groundwater may have caused substantial time lag between changes in input and output of nitrate in the studied catchments. Secondly, the loss of DIN might have been dominated by mineralisation of large pools of organic nitrogen that have accumulated over several years. These inferences are supported by (i) a hydrograph recession analysis and (ii) indications of DIN transformation processes, presumably denitrification, in smaller streams and channels, based on measurements in small agricultural catchments (1-4 km2) in Estonia and Latvia. Formal testing of trends in phosphorus data revealed that marked drops occurred in riverine concentrations at six sites in 1987-1998. A joint analysis of concentration time series for all sampling sites for 1987-1998 showed weak statistical significance for downward trends in NH4-N, NO 3-N, and DIN (p ? 0.04) and substantial significance for PO 4-P (p < 0.01). Thus, the extensive decrease in agricultural intensity that began in the early 1990s has led to only a slow and limited (especially regarding nitrogen) response in Latvian rivers. The difference noted between nitrogen and phosphorus also suggests that factors other than reduced fertiliser application influenced the inertia of the water quality response. Our findings, along with those obtained in similar studies, show that large cuts in nutrient inputs do not necessarily cause an immediate response, particularly in medium-sized and large catchment areas.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2009-10-07","2009-10-07","2017-12-13","","","5","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

Time series of nitrate (NO3-N) and phosphate (PO4-P) concentrations and data on runoff were selected to represent catchments with substantial areas of agricultural land and available time series of sufficient length and frequency. The study period was 1987-1998. We detected downward trends in nitrate-N and phosphate-P in only two of the four rivers. Our results imply that the response to the extensive decrease in agricultural intensity since the late 1980s has been slow and limited in many rivers. Corresponding results in the literature are inconclusive and comprise several examples of both decreasing and non-decreasing nutrient concentrations. Our findings, along with similar data from other studies, indicate that large cuts in nutrient inputs do not necessarily induce an immediate response, particularly in medium-sized and large catchment areas.

The aim of the present study was to examine how these exceptional decreases influenced the amounts of nutrients carried by the Elbe River to the North Sea. In particular, we attempted to extract anthropogenic signals from time series of riverine loads of nitrogen and phosphorus by developing a normalization technique that enabled removal of natural fluctuations caused by several weather-dependent variables. This analysis revealed several notable downward trends. The normalized loads of total-N and NO<sub>3</sub>-N exhibited an almost linear trend, even though the nitrogen surplus in agriculture dropped dramatically in 1990 and then slowly increased. Furthermore, the decrease in total-P loads was found to be considerably smaller close to the mouth of the river than further upstream. Studying the predictive ability of different normalization models showed the following: (i) nutrient loads were influenced primarily by water discharge; (ii) models taking into account water temperature, load of suspended particulate matter, and salinity were superior for some combinations of sampling sites and nutrient species; semiparametric normalization models were almost invariably better than ordinary regression models.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2005-12-16","2005-12-16","2009-05-19","","","3","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-5124","","","","","false","","",""

In particular, we present new methods for simultaneous extraction of a monotonic trend and seasonal components, and for normalisation of environmental quality data that are influenced by random variation in weather conditions or other forms of natural variability. The general aim of normalisation is to clarify the human impact on the environment by suppressing irrelevant variation in the collected data. Our method is designed for applications that satisfy the following conditions: (i) the response variable under consideration is a monotonic function of one or more covariates; (ii) the anthropogenic temporal trend is either increasing or decreasing; (iii) the seasonal variation over a year can be defined by one increasing and one decreasing function.

If the major problem consists of errors or uncertainty in the raw data, the sum of squares of all adjustments needed is minimized.

Accordingly, there is increasing interest in statistical normalisation techniques that can clarify the anthropogenic effects by removing meteorologically driven fluctuations and other natural variation in time series of environmental quality data. This thesis shows that semi- and nonparametric regression methods can provide effective tools for applying such normalisation to collected data. In particular, it is demonstrated how monotonic regression can be utilised in this context. A new numerical algorithm for this type of regression can accommodate two or more discrete or continuous explanatory variables, which enables simultaneous estimation of a monotonic temporal trend and correction for one or more covariates that have a monotonic relationship with the response variable under consideration. To illustrate the method, a case study of mercury levels in fish is presented, using body length and weight as covariates. Semiparametric regression techniques enable trend analyses in which a nonparametric representation of temporal trends is combined with parametrically modelled corrections for covariates. Here, it is described how such models can be employed to extract trends from data collected over several seasons, and this procedure is exemplified by discussing how temporal trends in the load of nutrients carried by the Elbe River can be detected while adjusting for water discharge and other factors. In addition, it is shown how semiparametric models can be used for joint normalisation of several time series of data.</p>","Hadi, Ali","Grimvall, Anders [andgr70] (Linköpings universitet [276], Institutionen för datavetenskap [281], ;;;Statistik [2172]) (Linköpings universitet [276], ;Filosofiska fakulteten [1750])","","","","","","","","BL32, B-huset, Campus Valla, Linköpings universitet, Linköping","eng","2005-12-16T10:15","2005-12-16","2005-12-16","2023-01-30","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:21036/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","1","","deprecated","","","","","","true","","",""

The reverse of the medal is that Web access is far from universal, and hence Web surveys only permit inference to populations of Web users. However, the Web can be used in combination with traditional response modes in a mixed-mode approach. Such an approach enables data collection from a probability sample of a general population, while still aiming at reducing costs by using the Web.</p><p>This thesis focuses on mixed-mode approaches in which (1) mail contacts are used and (2) a choice between a mail questionnaire and a Web questionnaire is offered.

A limited numerical study is performed to examine how the cost is influenced by the Web access rate and the Web response propensity. In the second paper, three mixed-mode approaches are evaluated empirically with respect to cost-efficiency. The mixed-mode approaches are compared with a mail-based reference approach with no Web response option. The cost-efficiency analysis is based on the results of a survey experiment, conducted in a population of university students in spring 2004.

If this experience could be quantified, it is possible to reduce the number of pills that must be selected for analysis. Recent results show that a Bayesian approach to sample size determination expresses the problem in a more natural way from a forensic point of view, provided an informative prior can be defined. Also, the sample sizes can be further reduced in this framework compared with the more classical Hypergeometric approach. These results have been adopted by the European Network of Forensic Sciences Institutes (ENFSI) in the Guideline on Representative Drug Sampling, published by ENFSI Drug Working Group. In this text, as well as in other published results, it is suggested to use a beta-prior which should be highly left-skewed when assumptions of the above kind can be done.

Specifically,we examined response surfaces and annual normalised means obtained byemploying purely additive models (AM), thin plate splines (TPS), andmonotonic regression (MR) to model mercury levels as functions of samplingyear and one or two covariates. Our analysis showed that TPS and MR modelscan be more satisfactory than purely additive models, because the formertechniques enable estimation of time-dependent relationships between themercury concentration and the covariates. However, the major obstacle fortrend assessment of the collected mercury data was a substantial interannualvariation that was related to factors other than body length and weight.Nevertheless, several time series of flounder data that started in the 1970s and1980s showed obvious downward trends, and these trends were particularly2strong in the Elbe estuary.

Notwithstanding, for drugs like Ecstacy, experience of forensic analysts indicates that a seizure of tablets usually consists either wholly of illicit drugs or no illegal substances at all. Consequently, it should be possible to draw fairly accurate conclusions based on very small samples, if all pills in a sample are indeed analytically identical. The forensic experience is modelled using a beta prior distribution for the proportion of drug-containing tablets in a seizure, and the sample size is determined so that a certain confidence statement can be made about this proportion. The parameters of the beta prior must be set to correspond with the experience, and this paper suggests a method for estimating these parameter values from a database comprising analyst reports representing the experience. The technique is applied to proportions of Ecstacy pills, and the results show that a sample of five pills is enough to state with a high level of confidence that at least half the tablets in a presumed Ecstacy seizure are genuine.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2009-10-10","2009-10-10","2017-12-13","","","1","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

Accordingly, sampling or inspection is usually sparse both in time and space. Typically, a grassland area is visited 1-2 times per decade, and each time 5-20 plots are inspected. For each plot (about one square meter) an inspection protocol, containing coverage data for up to 100 species, is established. The collected data can thus be characterized as high-dimensional and sparse. Moreover, it is not unusual that some of the monitored species are present in only a few of the investigated plots, i.e., the vectors of coverage data may contain numerous zeroes. The analysis of abundance data can be either multivariate or univariate. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA) are widely used multivariate methods. Univariate analyses are usually applied to summary statistics, such as diversity indices or measures of evenness. In either case, the complexity of the data makes it difficult to use parametric models for inference about the whole grassland, and modest sample sizes prevents using asymptotic results. Due to this, nonparametric methods, such as permutation tests, are often used to assess trends in abundance data. However, the power of these tests may be low due to the small number of sampling occasions. Here, we propose a resampling technique that can be used to determine the distribution of arbitrary estimators or test statistics based on high-dimensional abundance data. The original idea of the bootstrap is to substitute the true (but unknown) cumulative distribution function (cdf) for an empirical cumulative distribution function (edf) calculated from a sample of observations. When the collected data can be regarded as a simple random sample, the bootstrap principle provides a convenient method to determine the distributions of a large number of moment-related statistics (e.g. Singh, 1981). Also, it has been demonstrated that regression or time series data can be resampled by first extracting residuals (or innovations) and then forming pseudo data by resampling these residuals (Wu, 1989; Kreiss &amp; Franke, 1992). We propose high-dimensional abundance data be resampled by extracting residuals from a principal components factor analysis in which a small number of factors are retained. Furthermore, we handle point masses at zero (absent species) by using a truncated probit function to transform the original data prior to the principal components factor analysis, and to back-transform the pseudo data. The threshold and the number of factors retained are determined in such a way that the most important features of the resampled data are similar to those of the original observations in the most important resoe. In particular, the number of observed species should not differ too much. The latter is achieved by using a subsampling procedure, in which the number of zeros (i.e. non-observed species) in a subsample and in pseudo-data from that subsample are compared. Also, relative biases and coverage degrees of empirical confidence intervals are optimized. The performance of our procedure is illustrated by extensive simulations and a case study of temporal changes in Shannon entropy in a grassland in South West Sweden.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2009-10-10","2009-10-10","2010-09-28","","","1","","deprecated","","publishedPaper","","","","false","","",""

Tryptase was measured in blood from the femoral vein in 60 deaths: 39 control cases who died rapidly (within minutes) from natural causes (sudden cardiac death and acute aortic dissection), 16 with death caused by prolonged asphyxia (traumatic compression of the chest and suffocation due to body position or smothering), and five anaphylactic deaths. In 44 of these cases, tryptase was measured in both heart and femoral blood. Mast cell tryptase was analyzed with a commercial FEIA method (Pharmacia Diagnostics AB, Uppsala, Sweden) measuring both a- and ß-tryptase. Assuming that tryptase values in the control group were gamma distributed, we calculated the upper normal limits for tryptase concentrations in femoral blood. It was found that 95% of the controls had values below 44.3 µg/l (femoral blood), SD 5.27 µg/l. All but one of the anaphylactic deaths had tryptase concentrations exceeding that limit. Tryptase was significantly elevated in femoral blood from anaphylactic deaths (p&lt;0.007), compared with the controls. Also, in the cases where death had occurred due to asphyxia tryptase was elevated in femoral blood (p&lt;0.04). A significant difference in tryptase concentrations was seen between blood from the heart and the femoral vessels (p&lt;0.02) in the whole material (n=44). Tryptase concentrations in femoral blood were not influenced by prone position at death, or resuscitation efforts.

Given a vector $\bar{x} \in R^n$, find $x_* \in R^n$ which solves the problem:\begin{equation}\label{ir2}\begin{array}{cl}\mbox{min}  & \|x-\bar{x}\|^2 \\\mbox{s.t.} & Mx \ge 0.\end{array}\end{equation}The set of constraints $Mx \ge 0$ represents here the monotonicityrelations of the form $x_i \le x_j$ for a given set of pairs of thecomponents of $x$. The corresponding row of the matrix $M$ is composed mainly of zeros,but its $i$th and $j$th elements, which are equal to $-1$ and $+1$,respectively. The most challenging applications of (\ref{ir2}) arecharacterized by very large values of $n$. We introduce new IRalgorithms. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the high efficiencyof our algorithms, especially for very large-scale problems, and theirrobustness. They are able to solve some problems which all existing IRalgorithms fail to solve. We outline also our new algorithms formonotonicity-preserving interpolation of scattered multivariate data.In this talk we focus on application of our IR algorithms inpostprocessing of FE solutions.Non-monotonicity ofthe numerical solution is a typical drawback of the conventionalmethods of approximation, such as finite elements (FE), finite volumes,and mixed finite elements. The problem of monotonicity isparticularly important in cases of highly anisotropic diffusion tensorsor distorted  unstructured meshes. For instance, in the nuclear wastetransport simulation, the non-monotonicity results in the presence ofnegative concentrations which may lead to unacceptable concentrationand chemistry calculations failure. Another drawback of the conventionalmethods is a possible violation of the discrete maximum principle, whichestablishes lower and upper bounds for the solution.We suggest here a least-change correction to the available FE solution$\bar{x} \in R^n$. This postprocessing procedure is aimed on recoveringthe monotonicity and some other important properties that may not beexhibited by $\bar{x}$.The mathematical formulation of the postprocessing problemis reduced to the following convex quadratic programming problem\begin{equation}\label{ls2}\begin{array}{cl}\mbox{min}  & \|x-\bar{x}\|^2 \\\mbox{s.t.} & Mx \ge 0, \quad              l \le x \le u, \quad              e^Tx = m,\end{array}\end{equation}where$e=(1,1, \ldots ,1)^T  \in R^n$.  The set of constraints $Mx \ge 0$ represents here the monotonicityrelations between some of the adjacent mesh cells.The constraints $l \le x \le u$ originate fromthe discrete maximum principle. The last constraint formulates the conservativity requirement.The postprocessing based on (\ref{ls2}) is typically a large scaleproblem. We introduce here algorithms for solving this problem.

Tolerance time, pain threshold, and pain intensity were examined once a week during a 4-wk period, and serum concentrations of 17β-estradiol and progesterone were determined at each test session, which were classified into the early follicular phase, late follicular phase, early luteal phase, and late luteal phase, as determined by the first day of menses and the actual hormone levels recorded. A group of men (n = 10) of the same age interval was examined for comparison. The data show that pain threshold was reduced during the late luteal phase compared with the late follicular phase, and hormone analyses showed significant positive correlation between the progesterone concentration and lowered pain threshold and increasing pain intensity. Hormone analysis also showed an interaction between S-estradiol and S-progesterone on pain intensity, demonstrating that the increased perceived pain intensity that was associated with high progesterone concentrations was significantly reduced with increasing levels of estradiol. While no statistically significant sex differences in pain measurements were found, women displayed much more pronounced, and statistically significant, session-to-session effects than men, with increased pain threshold and decreased pain intensity with each test session. Hence, these data suggest that the changes in the serum concentration of gonadal hormones that occur during the menstrual cycle influence pain sensations elicited by noxious tonic cold stimulation and show that adaptation to the cold pressor test may be sex dependent. © 2007 the American Physiological Society.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2009-10-10","2009-10-10","2021-12-29","","","6","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-71210","","","","","true","","",""

This thesis is focused on design of computer experiments that can help us better understand the output from complex computer code models. The major part of our work was devoted to experiments involving derivation and application of computationally cheaper surrogate models of a given computer code model. We developed an adaptive sequential design algorithm that efficiently reveals nonlinearities in the model output, and we integrated this algorithm with methods for predicting model outputs at untried inputs. Compared to the methods currently in use, our sequential design has the advantage of not requiring any prior information about the response of the investigated model output to changes in the inputs. Of special interest, we found that our algorithm works satisfactorily even if the curvature of the response surface varies strongly over the input domain. Variance-based sensitivity analysis is a well-established technique to elucidate model outputs, but it can become prohibitively expensive to implement because it requires numerous model runs. Surrogate models can facilitate such analysis, and if our sequential design algorithm is utilized, it can supply useful information about both linear and nonlinear responses to model inputs. Experiments involving repeated runs of a model of the flow of water and nitrogen through a river basin showed that our approach can be applied to extract the essence of complex deterministic models. In addition, our research showed that computationally inexpensive surrogate models offer an ideal basis for interactive decision support tools and learning processes, because they can provide almost immediate responses to user-defined model inputs.</p>;<p>Datorexperiment används allmänt för att undersöka hur tekniska, ekonomiska och ekologiska system reagerar på förändringar i tillförsel eller drivkrafter. Denna avhandling är inriktad på datorexperiment som kan hjälpa oss att bättre förstå beräkningar baserade på komplicerade numeriska modeller som bara är definierade av en datorkod. Huvuddelen av vårt arbete ägnades åt experiment som innefattar härledning och tillämpning av beräkningsmässigt billiga s.k. surrogatmodeller som ger nästan samma resultat som ursprungsmodellen. Vi utvecklade en adaptiv sekventiell designalgoritm som effektivt avslöjar icke-linjära reaktioner på ändrad input till modellen, och vi integrerade denna algoritm med metoder för att prediktera modellens output för nya indata. Jämfört med de metoder som nu används har vår algoritm fördelen att den inte ställer några krav på förhandsinformation om modellens struktur. Speciellt noterade vi att den fungerar tillfredsställande även om olika delar av modellens responsyta har helt olika statistiska egenskaper. Varians-baserad känslighetsanalys är en väl etablerad teknik för att belysa modellers output, men den kan leda till höga datorkostnader eftersom den kräver många modellkörningar. Surrogatmodeller kan i sådana fall underlätta analysen. Om vår sekventiella designalgoritm utnyttjas, kan man desutom få viktig information om både linjära och icke-linjära effekter av förändringar i modellens indata. Experiment som innefattade upprepade körningar av en model för flödet av vatten och kväve genom ett avrinningsområde visade att man kan klarlägga det centrala i stora komplexa modeller. Dessutom visade vår forskning att beräkningsmässigt billiga surrogatmodeller erbjuder en idealisk grund för beslutstöd och lärandeprocesser, eftersom de kan ge en nästan omedelbar respons på de data som användaren matar in i modellen.</p>","Tarantola, Stefano, Dr.","Grimvall, Anders [andgr70], Professor (Linköpings universitet [276], Institutionen för datavetenskap [281], ;;;Statistik [2172]) (Linköpings universitet [276], ;Filosofiska fakulteten [1750])","","","","","","","","Alan Turing, hus E, Campus Valla, Linköpings universitet, Linköping","eng","2008-02-29T13:00","2009-03-06","2009-03-06","2018-01-13","","","1","","deprecated","","","","","","true","","",""

Here, we show how smooth trends in vector time series can be separated from one or two abrupt level shifts that occur simultaneously in all coordinates. Trends are modelled nonparametrically, whereas abrupt changes and the impact of covariates are modelled parametrically. The model is estimated using a backfitting algorithm in which estimation of smooth trends is alternated with estimation of regression coefficients for covariates and assessment of sudden level shifts. The proposed method is adaptive in the sense that the degree of smoothing over time and across coordinates is controlled by a roughness penalty and cross-validation procedure that automatically identifies the interdependence of the analysed data. Furthermore, it uses a resampling technique that can accommodate correlated error terms in the assessment of the uncertainty of both smooth trends and discontinuities. The method is applied to water quality data from Swedish national monitoring programmes to illustrate how known discontinuities can be quantified and how previously unrecognized discontinuities can be detected.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2009-12-11","2009-12-11","2011-05-20","","","3","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-43109","","","","","true","","",""

Without the support of long time series of reliable data, we would know much less about changes that occur in the environment and their causes. The present research aimed to explore how improved techniques for data analysis can help reveal flawed data and extract more information from environmental monitoring programmes. Based on our results, we propose that the organization of such monitoring should be transformed from a system for measuring and collecting data to an information system where resources have been reallocated to data analysis. More specifically, this thesis reports improved methods for joint analysis of trends in multiple time series and detection of artificial level shifts in the presence of smooth trends.

Here, we show how an additive model in which the multivariate trend function is specified in a nonparametric fashion (and the adjustment for covariates is based on a parametric expression) can be used to estimate how the human impact on an ecosystem varies with time and across components of the observed vector time series. More specifically, we demonstrate how a roughness penalty approach can be utilized to impose different types of smoothness on the function surface that describes trends in environmental quality as a function of time and vector component. Compared to other tools used for this purpose, such as Gaussian smoothers and thin plate splines, an advantage of our approach is that the smoothing pattern can easily be tailored to different types of relationships between the vector components. We give explicit roughness penalty expressions for data collected over several seasons or representing several classes on a linear or circular scale. In addition, we define a general separable smoothing method. A new resampling technique that preserves statistical dependencies over time and across vector components enables realistic calculations of confidence and prediction intervals.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2009-12-11","2009-12-11","2018-01-12","","","4","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-43109","","","","","true","","",""

A large share of this waste is today recovered and used for heat production. However, previous research has found that recovered wood waste (RWW) contains hazardous substances, which has significant implications for the environmental performance of recycling. Improved sorting is often suggested as a proper strategy to decrease such implications. In this study, we aim to analyse the impacts of waste regulation on the contamination of RWW. The occurrence of industrial preservative-treated wood, which contains several hazardous substances, was used as an indicator for contamination. First the management of RWW during 1995–2004 was studied through interviews with involved actors. We then determined the occurrence of industrial preservative-treated wood in RWW for that time period for each supplier (actor). From the results, it can be concluded that a substantially less contaminated RWW today relies on extensive source separation. The good news is that some actors, despite several obstacles for such upstream efforts, have already today proved capable of achieving relatively efficient separation. In most cases, however, the existing waste regulation has not succeeded in establishing strong enough incentives for less contaminated waste in general, nor for extensive source separation in particular. One important factor for this outcome is that the current market forces encourage involved actors to practice weak quality requirements and to rely on end-of-pipe solutions, rather than put pressure for improvements on upstream actors. Another important reason is that there is a lack of communication and oversight of existing waste regulations. Without such steering mechanisms, the inherent pressure from regulations becomes neutralized.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2006-10-09","2006-10-09","2019-06-13","","","4","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-7563","","","","","false","","",""

Our results demonstrate that powerful statistical tools for trend analysis can reveal flaws in the data and lead to new and revised interpretations of environmental data. In particular, we found strong evidence that long-term trends in measured nutrient concentrations can be more extensively influenced by changes in sampling and laboratory practices than by actual changes in the state of the environment. On a more general level, our findings raise important questions regarding the need for new paradigms for environmental monitoring and assessment. Introduction of a system in which conventional quality assurance is complemented with thorough statistical follow-up of reported values would represent a first step towards recognizing that environmental monitoring and assessment should be transformed from being a system for sampling and laboratory analyses into a system for interpreting information to support policy development.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2009-10-10","2009-10-10","2018-01-12","","","2","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-43109","","","","","true","","",""

Here, we suggest experimental designs and interpolation methods for extracting nonlinear response surfaces whose nonlinearity or roughness varies substantially over the input domain. A sequential design algorithm for cuboid domains is initiated by selecting an extended corner/centre point design for the entire domain. Additional design points are then generated by decomposing this domain into disjoint cuboids and taking the corners and centre of these cuboids as new design points. A roughness criterion based on local polynomial approximation of the response surface is used to control the domain decomposition so that the design becomes space-filling and the coverage is particularly good in the parts of the input domain where the response surface is strongly nonlinear. Finally, the model output at untried inputs is predicted by carefully selecting a local neighbourhood of each new point in the input space and fitting a full quadratic polynomial to the data points in that neighbourhood. Test runs with different types of nonlinear response surfaces showed that our sequential design algorithm automatically adapts to the nonlinear features of the model output. Moreover, we found that our design and interpolation technique is particularly useful for extracting nonlinear response surfaces from computer code models with two to seven input variables. A simple modification of the outlined algorithm enables adequate handling of non-cuboid input domains.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2009-03-06","2009-03-06","2018-01-13","","","2","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-17115","","","","","true","","",""

However, DNA samples from crime scenes often contain PCR-inhibitory substances, which may generate blank or incomplete DNA profiles. Extensive DNA purification can be required to rid the sample of these inhibitors, although these procedures increase the risk of DNA loss. Most forensic laboratories use commercial DNA amplification kits (e.g., AmpFlSTR SGM Plus) with the DNA polymerase AmpliTaq Gold as the gold standard. Here, we show that alternative DNA polymerase-buffer systems can improve the quality of forensic DNA analysis and efficiently circumvent PCR inhibition in crime scene samples, without additional sample preparation. DNA profiles from 20 of 32 totally or partially inhibited crime scene saliva samples were significantly improved using Bio-X-Act Short, ExTaq Hot Start, or PicoMaxx High Fidelity instead of AmpliTaq Gold.

Previous comparative studies are limited and often include few patients. Objective: To compare differences in stent patency, patient survival, and complication rates between covered and uncovered nitinol stents in patients with malignant biliary obstruction. Design: Randomized, multicenter trial conducted between January 2006 and October 2008. Setting: Ten sites serving a total catchment area of approximately 2.8 million inhabitants. Patients: A total of 400 patients with unresectable distal malignant biliary obstruction. Interventions: ERCP with insertion of covered or uncovered metal stent. Follow-up conducted monthly for symptoms indicating stent obstruction. Main Outcome Measurements: Time to stent failure, survival time, and complication rate. Results: The patient survival times were 116 days (interquartile range 242 days) and 174 days (interquartile range 284 days) in the covered and uncovered stent groups, respectively (P = .320). The first quartile stent patency time was 154 days in the covered stent group and 199 days in the uncovered stent group (P = .326). There was no difference in the incidence of pancreatitis or cholecystitis between the 2 groups. Stent migration occurred in 6 patients (3%) in the covered group and in no patients in the uncovered group (P = .030). Limitations: Randomization was not blinded. Conclusions: There were no significant differences in stent patency time, patient survival time, or complication rates between covered and uncovered nitinol metal stents in the palliative treatment of malignant distal biliary obstruction. However, covered stents migrated significantly more often compared with uncovered stents, and tumor ingrowth was more frequent in uncovered stents.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2010-12-03","2010-12-03","2011-01-19","","","20","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

The aim of this study is to determine the relation of chronic gastritis and other conditions to homocysteine levels and their relation to incident cardiovascular diseases and dementia. Methods An adult population-based cohort (N = 488) was screened for H. pylori infection, gastro-duodenitis ( endoscopic biopsies), disease history, and lifestyle factors. Blood samples were analyzed for pepsinogen I and II ( gastric function), vitamin B12, folate, homocysteine, and cystatin C ( renal function). The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T polymorphism reportedly associated with hyperhomocysteinemia was analyzed by pyrosequencing. Incident cardiovascular diseases and dementia were monitored during a median follow-up interval of 10 years. Results At baseline, there was a positive relation of S-homocysteine to male gender, age, S-cystatin C, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677TT genotype and atrophic gastritis. During follow-up, cardiovascular diseases occurred in 101/438 and dementia in 25/488 participants, respectively. Logistic regression analysis ( adjusting for gender, age at baseline, follow-up interval, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, NSAID use, P-cholesterol, and P-triglycerides) showed an association of S-homocysteine higher than 14.5 mu mol/l to cardiovascular diseases (OR 2.05 [95% c.i. 1.14-3.70]), but not to dementia overall. Conclusions Gender, age, vitamin B12, folate, renal function, atrophic gastritis and the methylenetetrahydrofolate 677TT genotype were significant determinants of homocysteine levels, which were positively related to incident cardiovascular diseases.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2010-02-01","2010-02-01","2019-06-27","","","6","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-56575","","","","","false","","",""

A central question is whether nerves in the operation field, when identified, should be preserved or resected. In the present study, the hypotheses that the identification and consequent resection of nerves at risk have no influence on postoperative pain has been tested. A single-centre study was conducted in 525 patients undergoing Lichtenstein hernioplasty. One surgeon (364 operations, Group A) consequently resected nerves at risk for being injured and nine surgeons (161 operations, Group B) adhered to the general routine of nerve preservation. All cases were ambulatory surgery on anaesthetised patients and the groups were similar with regard to age, body mass index (BMI) and preoperative pain. Self-reported pain at 3 months was recorded on a 10-box visual analogue scale (VAS). The identification and resection of nerves were continuously registered. Statistical calculations were performed with Fishers exact test and ordinal logistic regression. There was no significant difference in the number of identified nerves in the two groups of patients (iliohypogastricus, P = 0.555; ilioinguinalis, P = 0.831; genital branch, P = 0.214). However, the number of resected nerves was significantly higher in Group A for the iliohypogastric nerve, P andlt; 0.001, but not for ilioinguinalis, P = 0.064, and genital branch, P = 0.362. Non-identification of the ilioinguinal nerve correlated to the highest level of self-reported postoperative pain at 3 months. Patients in Group A, who had nerves at risk resected from the operation field, reported significantly less postoperative pain at 3 months, P = 0.007. This register study confirms the importance of nerve identification. Nerve resection strategy with the consequent removal of nerves at risk gives a significantly better outcome in Lichtenstein hernioplasty.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2010-06-11","2010-06-11","2010-06-11","","","3","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

Data are often scattered in space and time, and the inertia of groundwater systems can create natural, seemingly persistent changes in concentration that are difficult to separate from anthropogenic trends. Here, we show how statistical methods and software for joint analysis of multiple time series can be integrated into a roadmap for trend analysis and critical examination of data quality. Ordinary and partial Mann-Kendall (MK) tests for monotonic trends and semiparametric smoothers for multiple time series constitute the cornerstones of our procedure. The MK tests include a simple and easily implemented method to correct for serial dependence, and the associated software is designed to enable convenient handling of numerous data series and to accommodate covariates and nondetects. The semiparametric smoothers are intended to facilitate detection of synchronous changes in a network of stations. A study of Swedish groundwater quality data revealed true upward trends in acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC) and downward trends in sulphate, but also a misleading shift in alkalinity level that would have been difficult to detect if the time series had been analysed separately.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2009-12-11","2009-12-11","2010-05-31","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:280809/FULLTEXT02.pdf","","2","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-43109","","","","","true","","",""

In this domain, revenue or yield management principles have very strong relation to form it, which can be traced back over 30 years in the airline industry. In 1970 after release of pricing law by United States government, Pacific Southwest &amp; Southwest Airlines was the one, who first time introduced low cost airlines. Later in the mid of 1980’s, most of the US airlines introduced revenue management in response to those low-cost airlines. Many airlines used this principle and their profit margins increased exponentially. In a similar way the history of European low cost carriers began with the liberation of the flight market in the European Union. By the passage of time all most, all the developed countries adopt yield management principles to increase the profit turn margins but there is a huge gape for adopting this concept in the developing countries.

Here, we investigate methods for error bound estimation for the specific case of digital camera identification. The underlying probability distributions are continuous and previously proposed models for those are used, but the derived methodology is otherwise general.

The state-of-art today at several laboratories is to report the likelihood ratio but with a reservation stating its lack of validity if the stain originates from a close relative. Buckleton et al[†] derived a so-called extended likelihood ratio for reporting DNA evidence values when a full sibling is present in the set of potential alternative donors. This approach requires consideration of prior probabilities for each of the alternative donors to be the source of the stain and may therefore be problematic to apply in practice. Here we present an alternative way of using prior probabilities in the extended likelihood ratio when the latter is reported on an ordinal scale of conclusions. Our example show that for a 12 STR-marker profile using the extended likelihood ratio approach would not imply a change in the level reported compared to the ordinary likelihood ratio approach, unless the close relative has a very high prior probability of being the donor compared to an unrelated individual.</p><p>[†] Buckleton JS, Triggs CM, Champod C., <em>Science &amp; Justice </em><strong>46</strong>: 69-78.</p><p> </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015-06-01","2015-06-01","2015-06-10","","","3","","deprecated","","poster","ISFG2011. 24th World Congress of the International Society for Forensic Genetics","","","false","","",""

This thesis reports new statistical methodologies that can aid climate risk assessment under conditions of climate change. This increasing access to high temporal resolution of data is a central factor when developing novel techniques for this purpose. In particular, a procedure is introduced for analysis of long-term changes in daily and sub-daily records of observed or modelled weather extremes. Extreme value theory is employed to enhance the power of the proposed statistical procedure, and inter-site dependence is taken into account to enable regional analyses. Furthermore, new methods are presented to summarize and visualize spatial patterns in the temporal synchrony and dependence of weather events such as heavy precipitation at a network of meteorological stations. The work also demonstrates the significance of accounting for temporal synchrony in the diagnostics of inter-site asymptotic dependence.</p>;<p>Information om extrema väderhändelser är väsentligt för riskmedveten planering av infrastruktur och jordbruk. Sådan information kan också spela en avgörande roll för vår förmåga att anpassa oss till extremhändelser som är regelbundet återkommande eller mer eller mindre unika. Denna avhandling beskriver nya statistiska metoder som kan bidra till att bedöma klimatrisker när klimatet förändras. Den ökande tillgången till data med hög tidsupplösning är en central faktor när vi utvecklar nya tekniker för detta ändamål. Speciellt introducerar vi metodik för att analysera långsiktiga förändringar i dagliga eller ännu mera högupplösta data avseende observerade eller modellerade väderextremer. Extremvärdesteori utnyttias för att öka styrkan av statistiska tester, och hänsyn tas till beroendet mellan data från olika platser så att regionala bedömningar blir möjliga. Vidare presenteras nya metoder för att sammanfatta och visualisera rumsliga mönster i samstämmigheten av och beroendet mellan extrema väderhändelser såsom hög nederbördsintensitet i ett nätverk av meteorologiska stationer. Arbetet visar också betydelsen av ta hänsyn till den tidsmässiga överensstämmelsen när man undersöker det asymptotiska beroendet mellan extrema händelser vid olika stationer.</p>","Scott, Marian, Prof.","Grimvall, Anders [andgr70], Professor (Linköpings universitet [276], Institutionen för datavetenskap [281], ;;;Statistik [2172]) (Linköpings universitet [276], ;Filosofiska fakulteten [1750])","","","","","","","","Visionen, Hus B, Campus Valla, Linköpings universitet, Linköping","eng","2011-10-10T13:15","2011-08-30","2011-10-10","2014-10-07","","","1","","deprecated","","","","","","true","","",""

Evaluations still show that response programs are insufficiently supported by information systems. This paper sets out to derive a protocol for implementation of integrated information infrastructures supporting regional and local pandemic response programs at the stage(s) when the outbreak no longer can be contained at its source. Methods: Nominal group methods for reaching consensus on complex problems were used to transform requirements data obtained from international experts into an implementation protocol. The analysis was performed in a cyclical process in which the experts first individually provided input to working documents and then discussed them in conferences calls. Argument-based representation in design patterns was used to define the protocol at technical, system, and pandemic evidence levels. Results: The Protocol for a Standardized information infrastructure for Pandemic and Emerging infectious disease Response (PROSPER) outlines the implementation of information infrastructure aligned with pandemic response programs. The protocol covers analyses of the community at risk, the response processes, and response impacts. For each of these, the protocol outlines the implementation of a supporting information infrastructure in hierarchical patterns ranging from technical components and system functions to pandemic evidence production. Conclusions: The PROSPER protocol provides guidelines for implementation of an information infrastructure for pandemic response programs both in settings where sophisticated health information systems already are used and in developing communities where there is limited access to financial and technical resources. The protocol is based on a generic health service model and its functions are adjusted for community-level analyses of outbreak detection and progress, and response program effectiveness. Scientifically grounded reporting principles need to be established for interpretation of information derived from outbreak detection algorithms and predictive modeling.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2011-04-29","2011-04-29","2013-09-05","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:413603/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","10","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

Thereafter, the surrogate model can be employed to reduce the computational cost of a variance-based sensitivity analysis (VBSA) of the model output. Here, we draw attention to a procedure in which an adaptive sequential design is employed to derive surrogate models and estimate sensitivity indices for different sub-groups of inputs. The results of such group-wise VBSAs are then used to select inputs for a final VBSA. Our procedure is particularly useful when there is little prior knowledge about the response surface and the aim is to explore both the global variability and local nonlinear features of the model output. Our conclusions are based on computer experiments involving the process-based river basin model INCA-N, in which outputs like the average annual riverine load of nitrogen can be regarded as functions of 19 model parameters.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2011-04-08","2011-04-08","2011-04-08","","","2","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

Here, we report how this idea can be elaborated to provide an efficient test for trends at a network of stations. The initial step is to make separate estimates of tail probabilities of precipitation amounts for each combination of station and year by fitting a generalised Pareto distribution (GPD) to data above a user-defined threshold. The resulting time series of annual percentile estimates are subsequently fed into a multivariate Mann-Kendall (MK) test for monotonic trends. We performed extensive simulations using artificially generated precipitation data and noted that the power of tests for temporal trends was substantially enhanced when ordinary percentiles were substituted for GPD percentiles. Furthermore, we found that the trend detection was robust to misspecification of the extreme value distribution. An advantage of the MK test is that it can accommodate non-linear trends, and it can also take into account the dependencies between stations in a network. To illustrate our approach, we used long time series of precipitation data from a network of stations in The Netherlands.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2010-12-10","2010-12-13","2017-12-11","","","3","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-70282","","","","","false","","",""

This study uses data from a Scandinavian county (population 427.000) to investigate whether age was a determinant for being diagnosed with influenza 2005-2010 and to examine if age was associated with case timing during outbreaks. Aggregated demographic data were collected from Statistics Sweden, while influenza case data were collected from a county-wide electronic health record system. A logistic regression analysis was used to explore whether case risk was associated with age and outbreak. An analysis of variance was used to explore whether day for diagnosis was also associated to age and outbreak. The clinical case data were validated against case data from microbiological laboratories during one control year. The proportion of cases from the age groups 10-19 (p&lt;0.001) and 20-29 years old (p&lt;0.01) were found to be larger during the A pH1N1 outbreak in 2009 than during the seasonal outbreaks. An interaction between age and outbreak was observed (p&lt;0.001) indicating a difference in age effects between circulating virus types; this interaction persisted for seasonal outbreaks only (p&lt;0.001). The outbreaks also differed regarding when the age groups received their diagnosis (p&lt;0.001). A post-hoc analysis showed a tendency for the young age groups, in particular the group 10-19 year olds, led outbreaks with influenza type A H1 circulating, while A H3N2 outbreaks displayed little variations in timing. The validation analysis showed a strong correlation (r = 0.625;p&lt;0.001) between the recorded numbers of clinically and microbiologically defined influenza cases. Our findings demonstrate the complexity of age effects underlying the emergence of local influenza outbreaks. Disentangling these effects on the causal pathways will require an integrated information infrastructure for data collection and repeated studies of well-defined communities.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2012-04-27","2012-04-27","2021-06-14","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:524133/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","10","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

Methods: One hundred and forty patients with acute intra-abdominal infection requiring antibiotic treatment and hospitalization were included. Eight surgical units from the southern part of Sweden participated, between January 2006 and November 2007. Antibiotic treatments were according to local guidelines. Rectal swabs were obtained on admission (sample 1) and 2-14 days after the end of antibiotic treatment (sample 2). Aerobic bacteria and yeasts were analysed. The material was divided into 2 groups: 1 group with Enterobacteriaceae and 1 group with non-fermentative Gram-negative bacteria. The susceptibility to antibiotics in each group was compared between samples 1 and 2. Results: The main finding of this study on patients with severe intra-abdominal infections was a shift in the aerobic faecal flora following antibiotic treatment, from Escherichia coli to other more resistant Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus faecium, and yeasts. The susceptibility to cephalosporins and piperacillin-tazobactam decreased in Enterobacteriaceae. Conclusions: Following antibiotic treatment, a shift in the aerobic rectal flora to species with intrinsic antibiotic resistance was observed. This indicates that the emergence of resistance is not due to new mutations, but rather to selection of more resistant species. This should be taken into account when designing treatments for secondary intra-abdominal infections.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2012-12-19","2012-12-19","2017-12-06","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:579073/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","7","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-97709","","","","","false","","",""

Quantitative sensory tests (QST) were performed twice during the IVF-regimen: once during hormonal down-regulation and once during hormonal upregulation. A group of healthy men and a group of women using monophasic contraceptives were also examined, to control for session-to-session effects. Among the women undergoing IVF, serum 17β-estradiol levels differed strongly between treatments as expected, and increased from 65.7 (SD = 26) pmol/l during the downregulation phase, to 5188 (SD = 2524) pmol/l during the up-regulation phase. Significant outcomes in the QST were only seen for temperature perception thresholds (1.7°C vs. 2.2°C; P = 0.003) and cold pain threshold (11.5°C vs. 14.5°C; P = 0.04). A similar change in cold pain threshold was also seen in the two control groups, however, and statistical analysis suggested that this change was due to a session-to-session effect rather than being the result of hormonal modulation. Heat pain thresholds, heat tolerance, pressure pain thresholds, and the cold pressor test showed no significant differences between sessions. These data demonstrate that pain perception and pain thresholds in healthy women show little, if any, changes even with major variations in serum estradiol levels.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2011-11-08","2011-11-08","2021-12-29","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:454826/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","7","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-71210","","","","","true","","",""

An important approach to regression density estimation uses finite mixture models and our article considers flexible mixtures of heteroscedastic regression (MHR) models where the response distribution is a normal mixture, with the component means, variances and mixture weights all varying as a function of covariates. Our article develops fast variational approximation methods for inference. Our motivation is that alternative computationally intensive MCMC methods for fitting mixture models are difficult to apply when it is desired to fit models repeatedly in exploratory analysis and model choice. Our article makes three contributions. First, a variational approximation for MHR models is described where the variational lower bound is in closed form. Second, the basic approximation can be improved by using stochastic approximation methods to perturb the initial solution to attain higher accuracy. Third, the advantages of our approach for model choice and evaluation compared to MCMC based approaches are illustrated. These advantages are particularly compelling for time series data where repeated refitting for one step ahead prediction in model choice and diagnostics and in rolling window computations is very common.

Of particular importance is the use of a unified scale that allows interpretation of different kinds of evidence in one common framework. The logical approach to forensic interpretation comprises the use of the likelihood ratio as a measure of evidentiary strength. While fully understood by forensic scientists, the likelihood ratio may be hard to interpret for a person not trained in natural sciences or mathematics. Translation of likelihood ratios to an ordinal scale including verbal counterparts of the levels is therefore a necessary procedure for communicating evidence values to the police and in the courtroom. In this paper, we present a method to develop an ordinal scale for the value of evidence that can be applied to any type of forensic findings. The method is built on probabilistic reasoning about the interpretation of findings and the number of scale levels chosen is a compromise between a pragmatic limit and mathematically well-defined distances between levels. The application of the unified scale is illustrated by a number of case studies.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2012-03-27","2012-03-27","2017-12-07","","","4","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

Court officials can neither be expected to be able to interpret scientific data, nor is it their task to do so (in our opinion). The duty of the court is rather to perform the ultimate evidence evaluation of all the information in the case combined, including police reports, statements from suspects and victims, witness reports forensic expert statements, etc. Without the aid of the forensic expert, valuable forensic results may be overlooked or misinterpreted in this process. The scientific framework for forensic interpretation stems from Bayesian theory. The resulting likelihood ratio, which may be expressed using a verbal or a numerical scale, compares how frequent are the obtained results given that one of the propositions holds with how frequent  they are given that the other proposition holds. A common misunderstanding is that this approach must be restricted to forensic areas such as DNA evidence where extensive background information is present in the form of comprehensive databases. In this article we argue that the approach with likelihood ratios is equally applicable in areas where the results rely on scientific background data combined with the knowledge and experience of the forensic scientist. In such forensic areas the scale of the likelihood ratio may be rougher compared to a DNA case, but the information that is conveyed by the likelihood ratio may     nevertheless be highly valuable for the court.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2012-08-14","2012-08-14","2018-03-09","","","2","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

However, other types of variance estimators are needed when using monotonic regression (MR) models, which are particularly suitable for estimating response functions with pronounced thresholds. Here, we propose a simple bootstrap estimator to compensate for the over-fitting that occurs when MR models are estimated from empirical data.

Penalized regression approaches have been developed to overcome the challenges caused by the high dimensional data, but these methods are relatively new in the GWAS field. In this study we have compared the statistical performance of two methods (the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator—lasso and the elastic net) on two simulated data sets and one real data set from a 50 K genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel of 5570 Fleckvieh bulls. The first simulated data set displays moderate to high linkage disequilibrium between SNPs, whereas the second simulated data set from the QTLMAS 2010 workshop is biologically more complex. We used cross-validation to find the optimal value of regularization parameter λ with both minimum MSE and minimum MSE + 1SE of minimum MSE. The optimal λ values were used for variable selection. Based on the first simulated data, we found that the minMSE in general picked up too many SNPs. At minMSE + 1SE, the lasso didn't acquire any false positives, but selected too few correct SNPs. The elastic net provided the best compromise between few false positives and many correct selections when the penalty weight α was around 0.1. However, in our simulation setting, this α value didn't result in the lowest minMSE + 1SE. The number of selected SNPs from the QTLMAS 2010 data was after correction for population structure 82 and 161 for the lasso and the elastic net, respectively. In the Fleckvieh data set after population structure correction lasso and the elastic net identified from 1291 to 1966 important SNPs for milk fat content, with major peaks on chromosomes 5, 14, 15, and 20. Hence, we can conclude that it is important to analyze GWAS data with both the lasso and the elastic net and an alternative tuning criterion to minimum MSE is needed for variable selection.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2014-03-18","2014-03-18","2023-02-23","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:706038/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","5","","deprecated","","","","","","true","","",""

We investigated the associations between standardized multilocus heterozygosity (stMLH) in mother trees (obtained from12 nuclear microsatellite markers) and five fitness traits measured in progenies from an inbred Scots pine population. The traits studied were proportion of sound seed, mean seed weight, germination rate, mean family height of one-year old seedlings under greenhouse conditions (GH) and mean family height of three-year old seedlings under field conditions (FH). The relatively high average inbreeding coefficient (F) in the population under study corresponds to a mixture of trees with different levels of co-ancestry, potentially resulting from a recent bottleneck. We used both frequentist and Bayesian methods of polynomial regression to investigate the presence of linear and non-linear relations between stMLH and each of the fitness traits. No significant associations were found for any of the traits except for GH, which displayed negative linear effect with stMLH. Negative HFC for GH could potentially be explained by the effect of heterosis caused by mating of two inbred mother trees (Lippman and Zamir 2006), or outbreeding depression at the most heterozygote trees and its negative impact on the fitness of the progeny, while their simultaneous action is also possible (Lynch. 1991). However,since this effect wasn’t detected for FH, we cannot either rule out that the greenhouse conditions introduce artificial effects that disappear under more realistic field conditions.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2013-04-24","2013-04-24","2017-12-06","","","4","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

Moreover, methodological improvements in the neuroimaging pipeline, such as non-linear spatial normalization, non-parametric permutation tests and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approaches, can dramatically increase the computational burden. Despite these challenges, there do not yet exist any fMRI software packages which leverage inexpensive and powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) to perform these analyses. Here, we therefore present BROCCOLI, a free software package written in OpenCL (Open Computing Language) that can be used for parallel analysis of fMRI data on a large variety of hardware configurations. BROCCOLI has, for example, been tested with an Intel CPU, an Nvidia GPU, and an AMD GPU. These tests show that parallel processing of fMRI data can lead to significantly faster analysis pipelines. This speedup can be achieved on relatively standard hardware, but further, dramatic speed improvements require only a modest investment in GPU hardware. BROCCOLI (running on a GPU) can perform non-linear spatial normalization to a 1 mm3 brain template in 4–6 s, and run a second level permutation test with 10,000 permutations in about a minute. These non-parametric tests are generally more robust than their parametric counterparts, and can also enable more sophisticated analyses by estimating complicated null distributions. Additionally, BROCCOLI includes support for Bayesian first-level fMRI analysis using a Gibbs sampler. The new software is freely available under GNU GPL3 and can be downloaded from github (https://github.com/wanderine/BROCCOLI/).</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2014-03-17","2014-03-17","2024-01-17","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:705411/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","4","","deprecated","","","","","","true","","",""

These individuals suffer from narrow and/or closed airways to various extents. By calculating regional heterogeneity in lung ventilation SPECT images as the coefficient of variation (CV) in small elements of the lung, heterogeneity maps and CV-frequency curves can be generated and used to quantitatively measure heterogeneity. This work explores the potential to use such measurements to detect mild ventilation heterogeneities in lung healthy subjects.</p><p><strong>Method:</strong> Fourteen healthy subjects without documented lung disease or respiratory symptoms, and two patients with documented airway disease, inhaled on average approximately 90 MBq 99mTc-Technegas immediately prior to the 20 min SPECT acquisition. Variation in activity uptake between subjects was compensated for in resulting CV values. The area under the compensated CV frequency curve (AUC), for CV values greater than a threshold value CVT, AUC(CV&gt; CVT), was used as the measure of ventilation heterogeneity.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Patients with lung function abnormalities, according to lung function tests, generated higher AUC(CV&gt;20%) values compared to healthy subjects (p=0.006). Strong linear correlations with the AUC(CV&gt;20%) values were found for age (p=0.006) and height (p=0.001). These demonstrated that ventilation heterogeneities increased with age and that they depend on lung size. Strong linear correlations were found for the lung function value related to indices of airway closure/air trapping, RV/TLC (p=0.009), and DLCOc (p=0.009), a value partly related to supposed ventilation/perfusion mismatch. These findings support the association between conventional lung function tests and the AUC(CV&gt;20%) value.</p><p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> Among the healthy subjects there is a group with increased AUC(CV&gt;20%) values, but with normal lung function tests, which implies that it might be possible to differentiate ventilation heterogeneities earlier in a disease process than by lung function tests.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2014-05-19","2014-05-19","2023-12-28","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:717920/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","7","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-106667","","","","","true","","",""

When the control material source is not available for taking specimens or for investigating it in its entirety, we must stick to photographs or video take-ups for making comparisons. An example is the comparison of class characteristics between a recovered footwear print and a picture of a seized shoe, where the evaluation is occasionally made that way. However, this way of pursuing the investigation is due to needs of quick answers, when there is no or little time to send in the entire footwear for the comparison. Moreover, the pictures taken of the sole of the seized footwear are taken by the police under controlled conditions and with high quality equipment.</p><p>When the suspected source is captured on a lower quality video take-up and the recovered material consists of fragments from the original body of material – for instance fire debris – the comparison with the control material source is naturally more difficult. In this paper we present a case where the question is whether recovered fire debris originate from a piece of garment captured on a CCTV take-up. We show how a likelihood ratio for the two propositions can be indirectly obtained from a classification of the source of the fire debris, by using a Bayesian network model. Results from fire debris analysis as well as the results from image comparisons can be evaluated against propositions of class and the updating of the class node for fire debris propagates back to the propositions for source.</p><p>Feeding the network with uniform priors for the class nodes we show how simulation can be used to obtain the correct level of the likelihood ratio for further reporting.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015-06-01","2015-06-01","2015-06-01","","","9","","deprecated","","poster","9th International Conference on Forensic Inference and Statistics (ICFIS2014)","","","false","","",""

We administered a cross-sectional telephone survey to a representative sample (n = 443) of the Swedish adult population to examine whether self-reported intentions to improve personal hygiene and increase social distancing during influenza outbreaks could be explained by trust in official information, self-reported health (SF-8), sociodemographic factors, and determinants postulated in protection motivation theory, namely threat appraisal and coping appraisal. The interviewees were asked to make their appraisals for two scenarios: a) an influenza with low case fatality and mild lifestyle impact; b) severe influenza with high case fatality and serious disturbances of societal functions. Every second respondent (50.0%) reported high trust in official information about influenza. The proportion that reported intentions to take deliberate actions to improve personal hygiene during outbreaks ranged between 45–85%, while less than 25% said that they intended to increase social distancing. Multiple logistic regression models with coping appraisal as the explanatory factor most frequently contributing to the explanation of the variance in intentions showed strong discriminatory performance for staying home while not ill (mild outbreaks: Area under the curve [AUC] 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.82;0.89), severe outbreaks AUC 0.82 (95% CI 0.77;0.85)) and acceptable performance with regard to avoiding public transportation (AUC 0.78 (0.74;0.82), AUC 0.77 (0.72;0.82)), using handwash products (AUC 0.70 (0.65;0.75), AUC 0.76 (0.71;0.80)), and frequently washing hands (AUC 0.71 (0.66;0.76), AUC 0.75 (0.71;0.80)). We conclude that coping appraisal was the explanatory factor most frequently included in statistical models explaining self-reported intentions to carry out non-pharmaceutical health actions in the Swedish outlined context, and that variations in threat appraisal played a smaller role in these models despite scientific uncertainties surrounding a recent mass vaccination campaign.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2014-03-06","2014-03-06","2021-06-14","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:703313/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","11","","deprecated","","","","","","true","","",""

Already at the crime scene a lot of decisions have to be made about search strategies, the amount of evidence and traces recovered, later prioritised and sent further to the forensic laboratory etc. Within the laboratory there must be several criteria (often in terms of numbers) on how much and what parts of the material should be analysed. In addition there is often a restricted timeframe for delivery of a statement to the commissioner, which in reality might influence on the work done. The path of DNA evidence from the recovery of a trace at the crime scene to the interpretation and evaluation made in court involves several decisions based on cut-offs of different kinds. These include quality assurance thresholds like limits of detection and quantitation, but also less strictly defined thresholds like upper limits on prevalence of alleles not observed in DNA databases. In a verbal scale of conclusions there are lower limits on likelihood ratios for DNA evidence above which the evidence can be said to strongly support, very strongly support, etc. a proposition about the source of the evidence. Such thresholds may be arbitrarily chosen or based on logical reasoning with probabilities. However, likelihood ratios for DNA evidence depend strongly on the population of potential donors, and this may not be understood among the end-users of such a verbal scale. Even apparently strong DNA evidence against a suspect may be reported on each side of a threshold in the scale depending on whether a close relative is part of the donor population or not. In this presentation we review the use of thresholds and cut-offs in DNA analysis and interpretation and investigate the sensitivity of the final evaluation to how such rules are defined. In particular we show what are the effects of cut-offs when multiple propositions about alternative sources of a trace cannot be avoided, e.g. when there are close relatives to the suspect with high propensities to have left the trace. Moreover, we discuss the possibility of including costs (in terms of time or money) for a decision-theoretic approach in which expected values of information could be analysed.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015-06-01","2015-06-01","2015-06-10","","","3","","deprecated","","poster","9th International Conference on Forensic Inference and Statistics (ICFIS2014)","","","false","","",""

Study findings showed that a minority of adolescents in the study focal group (26%) did not complete high school, and women were more likely to educationally underachieve than men. A simultaneous multilevel logistic regression, with school class accounted for in the analysis, showed that for those of above average intelligence parents socioeconomic status and school grades were the strongest predictors of educational attainment. Finally, in midlife, underachievers had lower incomes and occupational levels, drank less frequently, and rated their health as worse than achievers.

Recently, the necessity for these systems to achieve two potentially conflicting requirements has been emphasized. First, they must be evidence-based; second, they must be adjusted for the diversity of populations, lifestyles, and environments.</p><p><strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong> The primary objective was to examine correlations between data from Google Flu Trends (GFT), computer-supported telenursing centers, health service websites, and influenza case rates during seasonal and pandemic influenza outbreaks. The secondary objective was to investigate associations between eHealth data, media coverage, and the interaction between circulating influenza strain(s) and the age-related population immunity.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> An open cohort design was used for a five-year study in a Swedish county (population 427,000). Syndromic eHealth data were collected from GFT, telenursing call centers, and local health service website visits at page level. Data on mass media coverage of influenza was collected from the major regional newspaper. The performance of eHealth data in surveillance was measured by correlation effect size and time lag to clinically diagnosed influenza cases.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Local media coverage data and influenza case rates showed correlations with large effect sizes only for the influenza A (A) pH1N1 outbreak in 2009 (r=.74, 95% CI .42-.90; P&lt;.001) and the severe seasonal A H3N2 outbreak in 2011-2012 (r=.79, 95% CI .42-.93; P=.001), with media coverage preceding case rates with one week. Correlations between GFT and influenza case data showed large effect sizes for all outbreaks, the largest being the seasonal A H3N2 outbreak in 2008-2009 (r=.96, 95% CI .88-.99; P&lt;.001). The preceding time lag decreased from two weeks during the first outbreaks to one week from the 2009 A pH1N1 pandemic. Telenursing data and influenza case data showed correlations with large effect sizes for all outbreaks after the seasonal B and A H1 outbreak in 2007-2008, with a time lag decreasing from two weeks for the seasonal A H3N2 outbreak in 2008-2009 (r=.95, 95% CI .82-.98; P&lt;.001) to none for the A p H1N1 outbreak in 2009 (r=.84, 95% CI .62-.94; P&lt;.001). Large effect sizes were also observed between website visits and influenza case data.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Correlations between the eHealth data and influenza case rates in a Swedish county showed large effect sizes throughout a five-year period, while the time lag between signals in eHealth data and influenza rates changed. Further research is needed on analytic methods for adjusting eHealth surveillance systems to shifts in media coverage and to variations in age-group related immunity between virus strains. The results can be used to inform the development of alert-generating eHealth surveillance systems that can be subject for prospective evaluations in routine public health practice.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2014-05-21","2014-05-21","2024-01-17","","","13","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-136553","","","","","true","","",""

The best performing telenursing complaint grouping in the retrospective algorithm calibration was fever (child, adult) and syncope (r=0.66; pless than0.001). In the prospective evaluation, the performance of 14-day predictions was acceptable for the part of the evaluation period including the 2009 influenza pandemic (area under the curve (AUC)=0.84; positive predictive value (PPV)=0.58), while it was strong (AUC=0.89; PPV=0.93) for the remaining evaluation period including only influenza winter seasons. We recommend the use of telenursing complaints for predicting winter influenza seasons.

Such an impurity pattern is a result of an incomplete cleaning-up process – typical for illicit manufacturing – when producing the drug. The manufacturing process can be divided into three steps: (1) choosing a recipe for how to produce; (2) producing amphetamine oil; and finally (3) precipitating the amphetamine from the oil.</p><p>The impurity pattern of the amphetamine will depend on the recipe itself, the conditions used for the synthesis, the precipitation process and the method of cleaning-up. The impurity profile is a chromatogram of around 150 different contaminants, of these contaminants 26 have been used by several European countries in police intelligence work to link manufacturers of illicit drugs [1]. However, the linkage methods used are investigative and not evaluative.   </p><p>The issue addressed when two specific seizures are to be compared, and the results are going to be used in the court of law, is whether they originate from the same precipitation batch.  When this is true the impurity patterns of the two seizures are in general expected to be similar, at least for stable contaminants. This is a less expected result if the seizures originate from different batches.</p><p>Interpretation of observed similarities and differences between the impurity patterns of two seizures is still to a large extent based on subjective judgements where in Sweden the experiences of two forensic experts are used. In this presentation we show how the so-called multivariate kernel likelihood ratio approach [2] can be used for this interpretation. From a designed experiment comprising several recipes, the variance components for a subset or for a lower-dimensional projection of all contaminants are estimated and likelihood ratios can then be easily calculated. A cross-validatory study shows high sensitivity as well as high specificity of the likelihood ratios.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015-06-01","2015-06-01","2015-06-01","","","3","","deprecated","","abstracts","9th International Conference on Forensic Inference and Statistics (ICFIS2014)","","","false","","",""

However, parental decisions on family size may correlate with variables affecting child cognitive performance. The aim of this study is to demonstrate how selection bias in studies of sibship size effects can be adjusted for. We extend existing knowledge in two aspects: as factors affecting decisions to increase family size may vary across the number and composition of current family size, we propose a sequential probit model (as opposed to binary or ordered models) for the propensity to increase family size; to disentangle selection and causality we propose multilevel multiprocess modelling where a continuous model for performance is estimated jointly with a sequential probit model for family size decisions. This allows us to estimate and adjust for the correlation between unmeasured heterogeneity affecting both family size decisions and child cognitive performance. The issues are illustrated through analyses of scores on Peabody individual achievement tests among children of the US National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. We find substantial between-family heterogeneity in the propensity to increase family size. Ignoring such selection led to overestimation of the negative effects of sibship size on cognitive performance for families with 1-3 children, when known sources of selection were accounted for. However, the multiprocess modelling proposed could efficiently identify and control for such bias due to adverse selection.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015-12-21","2015-12-22","2023-06-02","","","2","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

In this paper, we review the literature on classification methods for port efficiency, and present an approach that combines stochastic frontier analysis, clustering and self-organized maps (SOM). Cluster methodologies that build on the estimated cost function parameters could group ports into performance metrics categories. This helps when setting improvement targets for ports as a function of their specific cluster. The methodology is applied to a database of Spanish port authorities. The dendrogram features three clusters and five outlier Spanish Port Authorities. SOM are employed to track the temporal evolution of Spanish Port Authorities that are of special interest for some reasons (i.e. outliers).

Since accessibility and connectivity are major determinants of international transport costs, the analysis of their main ports connectivity is crucial for keeping costs under control. Since different port authorities manage the major ports of the Canary Islands, they could be tempted to compete for transshipment cargoes, instead of working together to facilitate supply chain integration that would increase their competitive standing. The aim of the paper is twofold. First, the infrastructure and superstructure endowment of the main Canarian ports and their accessibility, by evaluating site and situation factors, is documented. Secondly, the connectivity of the main Canarian ports is assessed by means of graph theory. This provides important measures that define a ports competitiveness, and its potential to achieve or keep regional or global hub status, and also to follow its evolution. A brief review of papers measuring port connectivity based on graph theory is included to illustrate the current approaches in port network analysis, and to justify our methodological framework. A sub-network of 53 ports directly related with Las Palmas and Tenerife ports has been selected for this purpose. Our findings are mainly related to the connections among the nodes in the sample network, and to the position that the targeted ports hold. Additionally, some policy recommendations, regarding how to improve the connectivity and competitiveness of the Canarian ports, are also enumerated. Previous analysis indicates that, at present, the Las Palmas port is the only regional hub in the Canaries. Both Canarian port authorities should differentiate themselves by specializing in certain valued added services and increasing traffic in these services. This would avoid the danger of a destructive competition between them to attract transit traffic. In summary they should be proactive in maintaining and improving the main Canarian ports connectivity.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015-03-13","2015-03-13","2017-12-04","","","3","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

Despite this fact, the validity of the statistical methods has only been tested using simulated data. By analyzing resting state fMRI data (which should not contain specific forms of brain activity) from 396 healthy con- trols, we here show that all three software packages give in- flated false positive rates (4%-96% compared to the expected 5%). We isolate the sources of these problems and find that SPM mainly suffers from a too simple noise model, while FSL underestimates the spatial smoothness. These results highlight the need of validating the statistical methods being used for fMRI. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015-06-25","2015-06-25","2018-01-11","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:826782/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","4","","deprecated","","publishedPaper","IEEE 12th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging","","","true","","",""

Here, the aim was to evaluate potential gender differences in the treatment for bipolar disorder. Methods: Data was collected from the Swedish National Quality Assurance Register for bipolar disorder (BipolaR). Baseline registrations from the period 2004-2011 of 7354 patients were analyzed. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to study the impact of gender on interventions. Results: Women were more often treated with antidepressants, lamotrigine, electroconvulsive therapy, benzodiazepines, and psychotherapy. Men were more often treated with lithium. There were no gender differences in treatment with mood stabilizers as a group, neuroleptics, or valproate. Subgroup analyses revealed that ECT was more common in women only in the bipolar l subgroup. Contrariwise, lamotrigine was more common in women only in the bipolar II subgroup. Limitations: As BipolaR contains data on outpatient treatment of persons with bipolar disorder in Sweden, it is unclear if these Findings translate to inpatient care and to outpatient treatment in other countries. Conclusions: Men and women with bipolar disorder receive different treatments in routine clinical settings in Sweden. Gender differences in level of functioning, bipolar subtype, or severity of bipolar disorder could not explain the higher prevalence of pharmacological treatment, electroconvulsive therapy, and psychotherapy in women. Our results suggest that clinicians treatment decisions are to some extent unduly influenced by patients gender. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Second, we propose a perception-aware adaptive scheme that sets the resolution during game play. We exploit the fact that game players are often willing to trade quality for longer battery life. Our scheme uses decision theory, where the predicted user perception is combined with a novel asymmetric loss function that encodes users' alterations in their willingness to save power.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016-02-02","2016-02-02","2018-12-07","","","5","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-152469","publishedPaper","Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD), 2015 IEEE/ACM International Conference on 2-6 Nov. 2015 Austin, TX","","","false","","",""

However, the expression of p53 mediated miRNAs, cyto- and chemokines after radiation and SN38 treatment in colon cancer remains elusive. Here, human colon cancer cells, HCT116 with wild-type, heterozygous and a functionally null p53, were treated by radiation and SN38. The expression of 384 miRNAs was determined by using the TaqMan (R) miRNA array, and the expression of cyto- and chemokines was analyzed by Meso-Scale-Discovery instrument. Up- or down-regulations of miRNAs after radiation and SN38 treatments were largely dependent on p53 status of the cells. Cytokines, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, Il-4, IL-10, VEGF, and chemokines, IL-8, MIP-1 alpha were increased, and IFN-gamma expression was decreased after radiation, whereas, IL-6, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, Il-4, IL-10, IL-8 were decreased, and VEGF and MIP-1 alpha were increased after SN38 treatment. Bioinformatic analysis pointed out that the highly up-regulated miRNAs, let-7f-5p, miR-455-3p, miR-98, miR-155-5p and the down-regulated miRNAs, miR-1, miR-127-5p, miR-142-5p, miR-202-5p were associated with colon cancer pathways and correlated with cyto- or chemokine expression.

However, these studies are biased by the lack of detailed demand data on international connections. Using an MIDT dataset comprising a sample of domestic and international markets served by US airports during the first quarter of 2013, this paper aims at providing a full picture on the pitfalls of the existing FAA method, as well as addressing the impact of international connectivity in characterising the airports hubbing profiles. Hierarchical clustering is used to provide alternative criteria for hub classification within the context of US National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS). This new typology of primary US airports can help to optimize AIP funding by allowing for further differentiation in the FAA allocation criteria.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015-02-16","2015-02-16","2017-12-04","","","3","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

Design: Observational study over a 2-year period. Setting: Young Adults Centre providing psychological services by self-referral (preprimary care) to Linkoping, Atvidaberg, and Kinda municipalities (combined population 145 000) in Ostergotland county, Sweden. Participants: 607 young adults (16-25 years of age); 71% females (n= 429). Intervention: Individually scheduled cognitive behavioural therapy delivered in up to six 45 min sessions structured according to an assessment of the clients mental health problems: anxiety, depression, anxiety and depression combined, or decreased distress without specific anxiety or depression. Primary outcome measures: Pre-post intervention changes in psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire-12, GHQ-12), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Anxiety/Depression (HADS-A/D). Results: 192 clients (32.5%) discontinued the intervention on their own initiative and 39 clients (6.6%) were referred to a psychiatric clinic during the course of the intervention. Intention-to-treat analyses including all clients showed a medium treatment effect size (d= 0.64) with regard to psychological distress, and small effect sizes were observed with regard to anxiety (d= 0.58) and depression (d= 0.57). Restricting the analyses to clients who adhered to the agreed programme, a large effect size (d= 1.26) was observed with regard to psychological distress, and medium effect sizes were observed with regard to anxiety (d= 1.18) and depression (d= 1.19). Lower age and a high initial HADS-A score were the strongest risk factors for non-adherence, and inability to concentrate and thinking of oneself as a worthless person increased the risk for discontinuation. Conclusions: We conclude that provision of psychological services to young people through a self-referral centre has potential to improve long-term mental health in communities, but management of non-adherence remains a central challenge.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015-11-23","2015-12-14","2023-08-28","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:882346/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","8","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

Previous studies in Sweden have primarily focused on incidence of acute gastrointestinal illness related to consumption of contaminated food and drinking water. Methods: In May 2009, we sent a questionnaire to 4000 randomly selected persons aged 0-85 years, asking about the number of episodes of stomach disease during the last 12 months. To validate the data on symptoms, we compared the study results with anonymous queries submitted to a Swedish medical website. Results: The response rate was 64%. We estimated that a total number of 2744,778 acute gastrointestinal illness episodes (95% confidence intervals 2475,641-3013,915) occurred between 1 May 2008 and 30 April 2009. Comparing the number of reported episodes with web queries indicated that the low number of episodes during the first 6 months was an effect of seasonality rather than recall bias. Further, the result of the recall bias analysis suggested that the survey captured approximately 65% of the true number of episodes among the respondents. Conclusions: The estimated number of Swedish acute gastrointestinal illness cases in this study is about five times higher than previous estimates. This study provides valuable information on the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms in Sweden, irrespective of route of transmission, indicating a high burden of acute gastrointestinal illness, especially among children, and large societal costs, primarily due to production losses.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015-07-31","2015-07-31","2017-12-04","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:843877/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","7","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

Methods: In patients with HFrEF in the Swedish Heart Failure Registry, we assessed hemoglobin levels and associations between baseline characteristics and anemia with logistic regression. Using propensity scores for anemia, we assessed the association between anemia and outcomes with Cox regression, and performed interaction and sub-group analyses. Results: There were 24 511 patients with HFrEF (8303 with anemia). Most important independent predictors of anemia were higher age, male gender and renal dysfunction. One-year survival was 75% with anemia vs. 81% without (p &amp;lt; 0.001). In the matched cohort after propensity score the hazard ratio associated with anemia was for all-cause death 1.34 (1.28-1.40; p &amp;lt; 0.0001), CV mortality 1.28 (1.20-1.36; p &amp;lt; 0.0001), and combined CV mortality or HF hospitalization 1.24 (1.18-1.30; p &amp;lt; 0.0001). In interaction analyses, anemia was associated with greater risk with lower age, male gender, EF 30-39%, and NYHA-class I-II. Conclusion: In HFrEF, anemia is associated with higher age, male gender and renal dysfunction and increased risk of mortality and morbidity. The influence of anemia on mortality was significantly greater in younger patients, in men, and in those with more stable HF. The clinical implication of these findings might be in the future to perform targeted treatment studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, a known drawback of this method is that its fitted response is a piecewise constant function, while practical response functions are often required to be continuous. The method proposed in this paper achieves monotonicity and smoothness of the regression by introducing an L2 regularization term, and it is shown that the complexity of this method is <em>O</em>(n<sup>2</sup>). In addition, our simulations demonstrate that the proposed method normally has higher predictive power than some commonly used alternative methods, such as monotonic kernel smoothers. In contrast to these methods, our approach is probabilistically motivated and has connections to Bayesian modeling.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016-02-22","2016-02-22","2016-09-26","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:905380/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","2","","deprecated","","","","","","true","","",""

Our approach addresses two problems identified in user studies of AFL tools. The first problem concerns the trust in which the user can put in the results of the tool. The second problem concerns understanding how the results were computed. The proposed model quantifies the uncertainty in its predictions and all estimated model parameters. Additionally, the output of the model explains why a result was suggested.

Nevertheless, the computational burden can be prohibitively large for resampling techniques in which numerous datasets are processed independently of each other. Here, we present efficient algorithms for estimation of confidence limits in large-scale settings that take into account the similarity of the bootstrap or jackknifed datasets to which MR models are fitted. In addition, we introduce modifications that substantially improve the accuracy of MR solutions for binary response variables. The performance of our algorithms isillustrated using data on death in coronary heart disease for a large population.

For a nominal familywise error rate of 5%, the parametric statistical methods are shown to be conservative for voxelwise inference and invalid for clusterwise inference. Our results suggest that the principal cause of the invalid cluster inferences is spatial autocorrelation functions that do not follow the assumed Gaussian shape.

Currently, there is a lack of knowledge about how long it takes for an increased FC level to return to normal after NSAID intake. Objective. The aim was to investigate how oral diclofenac intake affects FC levels and assess how long it takes for an increased FC level to return to normal after oral diclofenac intake. Material and methods. Thirty healthy volunteers received diclofenac 50 mg three times daily for 14 days. Participants provided a stool sample on Days 0, 2, 4, 7, 14 during intake and Days 17, 21, 28 after discontinuation. FC levels were then followed at 7-day intervals until normalization. Results. During diclofenac intake, eight participants (27%) had FC levels exceeding the upper limit of normal (median, 76 mu g/g; range, 60-958 mu g/g), corresponding to 8.3% of measurements. FC was not constantly increased and became normal in most participants during diclofenac intake. FC levels were on average significantly higher during intake (M = 9.5, interquartile range (IQR) = 13.4) than on baseline (M = 7.5, IQR = 0.0), p = 0.003. After discontinuation, two participants had increased FC on Days 17 and 21, respectively. No significant differences in FC levels were found between baseline and measurements after discontinuation. Two weeks after discontinuation, all participants had normal FC levels. Conclusions. Short-term oral diclofenac intake is associated with increased FC levels. However, the likelihood of an increased test result is low. Our results suggest that 2 weeks of diclofenac withdrawal is sufficient to get an uninfluenced FC test result.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016-05-03","2016-05-03","2023-08-18","","","7","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-197024","","","","","false","","",""

Here, we use a machine learning algorithm to capture the normal behavior of the system according to its dynamics. On the other hand, the control performance strongly depends on the amount of allocated resources and this can be used to address the intrusion-damage mitigation problem.

Both airports and airlines, particularly low-cost carriers, have recently started catering to the needs of this type of passengers with the introduction of transfer fees or the development of self-connection platforms. The evidence provided by the existing literature, however, suggests that the degree of implementation of these strategies falls short of its true potential. In order to investigate how much self-connectivity could be observed in global air transport markets, this paper develops a forecasting model based on a zero-inflated Poisson regression on MIDT data. We identify the airports that have the highest potential to facilitate self-connections, as well as the factors that hinder or facilitate the necessary airline agreements at major locations. The results from this paper have many implications in regards to the widespread implementation of self-connection services and the future of the air travel industry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

One of its features, which poses a limitation on its use in some areas, is that it produces a piecewise constant fitted response. For smoothing the fitted response, we introduce a regularization term in the MR formulated as a least distance problem with monotonicity constraints. The resulting Smoothed Monotonic Regrassion (SMR) is a convex quadratic optimization problem. We focus on the SMR, where the set of observations is completely (linearly) ordered. Our Smoothed Pool-Adjacent-Violators (SPAV) algorithm is designed for solving the SMR. It belongs to the class of dual activeset algorithms. We proved its finite convergence to the optimal solution in, at most, n iterations, where n is the problem size. One of its advantages is that the active set is progressively enlarging by including one or, typically, more constraints per iteration. This resulted in solving large-scale SMR test problems in a few iterations, whereas the size of that problems was prohibitively too large for the conventional quadratic optimization solvers. Although the complexity of the SPAV algorithm is <em>O</em>(n<sup>2</sup>), its running time was growing in our computational experiments in proportion to <em>n<sup>1:16</sup></em>.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016-05-17","2016-05-17","2016-09-28","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:929073/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","2","","deprecated","","","","","","true","","",""

Using an MIDT dataset of worldwide passenger itineraries served by the European airport network during May 2013, we first establish whether London Heathrow can currently be considered the most important hub for the UK, in terms of traffic generation, connectivity, and centrality, while also measuring the dependence of UK regions on foreign airports and airlines to remain connected with the rest of the world. Results show that, despite the competition, London Heathrow benefits from its massive traffic generation to remain the most central gateway for overall UK air transport markets. However, when only regional markets are considered, significant dependence on foreign hubs appears in many destinations, particularly to Asia Pacific or the BRIC countries where above 80% of passengers use transfer flights. These results fit nicely with the observed trends of seat de-concentration and hub-bypassing in the airline industry. While dependence on foreign hubs can be interpreted as a sign of vulnerability, there is also the argument that bypassing Heathrow allows regional airports to develop new markets and reduce the level of congestion in the London airport system.

We develop a highly efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that allows for Bayesian variable selection among the regressors to model both the mean (i.e., the design matrix) and variance. This makes it possible to include a broad range of explanatory variables in both the mean and variance (e.g., time trends, activation stimuli, head motion parameters and their temporal derivatives), and to compute the posterior probability of inclusion from the MCMC output. Variable selection is also applied to the lags in the autoregressive noise process, making it possible to infer the lag order from the data simultaneously with all other model parameters. We use both simulated data and real fMRI data from OpenfMRI to illustrate the importance of proper modeling of heteroscedasticity in fMRI data analysis.

One of its features, which poses a limitation on its use in some areas, is that it produces a piecewise constant fitted response. For smoothing the fitted response, we introduce a regularization term in the monotonic regression, formulated as a least distance problem with monotonicity constraints. The resulting smoothed monotonic regression is a convex quadratic optimization problem. We focus on the case, where the set of observations is completely (linearly) ordered. Our smoothed pool-adjacent-violators algorithm is designed for solving the regularized problem. It belongs to the class of dual active-set algorithms. We prove that it converges to the optimal solution in a finite number of iterations that does not exceed the problem size. One of its advantages is that the active set is progressively enlarging by including one or, typically, more constraints per iteration. This resulted in solving large-scale test problems in a few iterations, whereas the size of that problems was prohibitively too large for the conventional quadratic optimization solvers. Although the complexity of our algorithm grows quadratically with the problem size, we found its running time to grow almost linearly in our computational experiments.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017-01-24","2017-01-24","2017-04-20","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1068281/FULLTEXT02.pdf","","2","","deprecated","","","","","","true","true","",""

Monotonic (isotonic) Regression (MR) is often involved in solving such problems. The MR solutions are of a step-shaped form with a typical sharp change of values between adjacent steps. This, in some applications, is regarded as a disadvantage. We recently introduced a Smoothed MR (SMR) problem which is obtained from the MR by adding a regularization penalty term. The SMR is aimed at smoothing the aforementioned sharp change. Moreover, its solution has a far less pronounced step-structure, if at all available. The purpose of this paper is to further improve the SMR solution by getting rid of such a structure. This is achieved by introducing a lowed bound on the slope in the SMR. We call it Smoothed Slope-Constrained MR (SSCMR) problem. It is shown here how to reduce it to the SMR which is a convex quadratic optimization problem. The Smoothed Pool Adjacent Violators (SPAV) algorithm developed in our recent publications for solving the SMR problem is adapted here to solving the SSCMR problem. This algorithm belongs to the class of dual active-set algorithms. Although the complexity of the SPAV algorithm is <em>o</em>(<em>n</em><sup>2</sup>) its running time is growing in our computational experiments almost linearly with <em>n</em>. We present numerical results which illustrate the predictive performance quality of our approach. They also show that the SSCMR solution is free of the undesirable features of the MR and SMR solutions.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018-05-29","2018-05-29","2018-06-07","","","2","","deprecated","","","","","","true","","",""

We compare FA (fractional anisotropy) maps for various b-values using three diffusion tensor estimation methods: least-squares and MCMC with and without spatial priors.

The estimated single-diffusion tensors within each voxel are compared with respect to fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Using data from the Human Connectome Project, our results show that the noise is clearly heteroscedastic, especially the posterior variance for MD is substantially underestimated by the homoscedastic model, and inferences from the homoscedastic model are on average spuriously precise.

In this work, we introduce a framework for creating, testing, versioning and archiving portable applications for analyzing neuroimaging data organized and described in compliance with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS). The portability of these applications (BIDS Apps) is achieved by using container technologies that encapsulate all binary and other dependencies in one convenient package. BIDS Apps run on all three major operating systems with no need for complex setup and configuration and thanks to the comprehensiveness of the BIDS standard they require little manual user input. Previous containerized data processing solutions were limited to single user environments and not compatible with most multi-tenant High Performance Computing systems. BIDS Apps overcome this limitation by taking advantage of the Singularity container technology. As a proof of concept, this work is accompanied by 22 ready to use BIDS Apps, packaging a diverse set of commonly used neuroimaging algorithms.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017-03-15","2017-03-15","2019-07-04","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1081782/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","29","","deprecated","","","","","e1005209","false","true","",""

Participants were 900 Swedish students from 43 classrooms, ranging in age from 9 to 13 years. Multilevel regression analyses revealed that passive reactions by bystanders were associated with greater moral disengagement and less defender self-efficacy. Defending, in turn, was associated with less moral disengagement and greater defender self-efficacy and classroom student–student relationship quality. Furthermore, students who scored high in moral disengagement were even less prone to defend victims when the classroom student–student relationship quality was low, but more prone to act as defenders when the classroom student–student relationship quality was high. In addition, the negative association between defender self-efficacy and passive bystanding was stronger both in classrooms with higher student–student relationship quality and in those with lower class moral disengagement.

Using Bayesian varying-intercept modeling we account for differences between school classes in each of our three response variables: IQ-scores, school grades and adult income, and control for background variables such as gender, socioeconomic status, and maternal- and paternal age. Consistent with previous research, we find patterns of decreasing IQ scores for increasing sibship sizes, specifically for an increasing number of older siblings. No relationships between sibship size and childrens school grades are found. We find, however, patterns of decreasing adult income for an increasing number of younger siblings. In addition, considerable amounts of variations in intelligence scores as well as school grades are found between school classes.

Most of the currently proposed methods therefore do inference in subregions of the brain separately or do approximate inference without comparison to the true posterior distribution. A popular such method, which is now the standard method for Bayesian single subject analysis in the SPM software, is introduced in Penny et al. (2005b). The method processes the data slice-by-slice and uses an approximate variational Bayes (VB) estimation algorithm that enforces posterior independence between activity coefficients in different voxels. We introduce a fast and practical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme for exact inference in the same model, both slice-wise and for the whole brain using a 3D prior on activity coefficients. The algorithm exploits sparsity and uses modern techniques for efficient sampling from high-dimensional Gaussian distributions, leading to speed-ups without which MCMC would not be a practical option. Using MCMC, we are for the first time able to evaluate the approximate VB posterior against the exact MCMC posterior, and show that VB can lead to spurious activation. In addition, we develop an improved VB method that drops the assumption of independent voxels a posteriori. This algorithm is shown to be much faster than both MCMC and the original VB for large datasets, with negligible error compared to the MCMC posterior.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016-12-05","2016-12-05","2020-06-29","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1051973/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","4","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-165872","","","","","true","","",""

For the syndromic data, none of the detection algorithms displayed a satisfactory performance, while non-adaptive log-linear regression was the best performing prediction method. We conclude that evidence was found for that available algorithms for influenza detection and prediction display satisfactory performance when applied on local diagnostic data during winter influenza seasons. When applied on local syndromic data, the evaluated algorithms did not display consistent performance. Further evaluations and research on combination of methods of these types in public health information infrastructures for nowcasting (integrated detection and prediction) of influenza activity are warranted.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017-08-16","2017-08-16","2018-04-20","","","4","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

The rapidly growing availability of electronic ""big data"" from diagnostic and prediagnostic sources in health care and public health settings permits advance of a new generation of methods for local detection and prediction of winter influenza seasons and influenza pandemics. Objective: The aim of this study was to present a method for integrated detection and prediction of influenza virus activity in local settings using electronically available surveillance data and to evaluate its performance by retrospective application on authentic data from a Swedish county. Methods: An integrated detection and prediction method was formally defined based on a design rationale for influenza detection and prediction methods adapted for local surveillance. The novel method was retrospectively applied on data from the winter influenza season 2008-09 in a Swedish county (population 445,000). Outcome data represented individuals who met a clinical case definition for influenza (based on International Classification of Diseases version 10 [ICD-10] codes) from an electronic health data repository. Information from calls to a telenursing service in the county was used as syndromic data source. Results: The novel integrated detection and prediction method is based on nonmechanistic statistical models and is designed for integration in local health information systems. The method is divided into separate modules for detection and prediction of local influenza virus activity. The function of the detection module is to alert for an upcoming period of increased load of influenza cases on local health care (using influenza-diagnosis data), whereas the function of the prediction module is to predict the timing of the activity peak (using syndromic data) and its intensity (using influenza-diagnosis data). For detection modeling, exponential regression was used based on the assumption that the beginning of a winter influenza season has an exponential growth of infected individuals. For prediction modeling, linear regression was applied on 7-day periods at the time in order to find the peak timing, whereas a derivate of a normal distribution density function was used to find the peak intensity. We found that the integrated detection and prediction method detected the 2008-09 winter influenza season on its starting day (optimal timeliness 0 days), whereas the predicted peak was estimated to occur 7 days ahead of the factual peak and the predicted peak intensity was estimated to be 26% lower than the factual intensity (6.3 compared with 8.5 influenza-diagnosis cases/100,000). Conclusions: Our detection and prediction method is one of the first integrated methods specifically designed for local application on influenza data electronically available for surveillance. The performance of the method in a retrospective study indicates that further prospective evaluations of the methods are justified.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017-09-13","2017-09-13","2024-01-17","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1140808/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","5","","deprecated","","","","","e211","false","","",""

In order to account for the clustered nature of the data with students nested within school classes, a multilevel regression model was analysed. Consistent with our hypotheses, and after controlling for age, gender and ethnic background at the individual level and class size and the proportion of boys at the class level, both class relational climate and class moral disengagement uniquely contributed to explaining the between-class variance in victimisation.

The accuracy of the proposed model outperforms historical means and other simpler methods on a network of 47 streets in Stockholm, by using probe data from GPS-equipped taxis.

The standard OU process includes random perturbations and stabilizing selection and assumes that species evolve independently. However, evolving species may interact through various ecological process and also exchange genes especially in plants. This is particularly true if we want to study phenotypic evolution among diverging populations within species. In this work we present a straightforward statistical approach with analytical solutions that allows for the inclusion of adaptation and migration in a common phylogenetic framework, which can also be useful for studying local adaptation among populations within the same species. We furthermore present a detailed simulation study that clearly indicates the adverse effects of ignoring migration. Similarity between species due to migration could be misinterpreted as very strong convergent evolution without proper correction for these additional dependencies. Finally, we show that our model can be interpreted in terms of ecological interactions between species, providing a general framework for the evolution of traits between ""interacting"" species or populations.(C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the current study was to examine whether authoritative classroom climates were associated with bullying victimization and various bystander behaviors (reinforcer, outsider, and defender behaviors) in school bullying. We included gender as a covariate at the individual and classroom levels. Participants were 1540 5th-grade students (824 girls) from 104 classrooms in Sweden who completed a questionnaire. The findings revealed that girls and students in classes with greater authoritative classroom climates were more inclined to defend. Boys reinforced more as did students in classes with more boys and more authoritative classroom climates. Boys showed more outsider behaviors as did students in classes with less authoritative classroom climates. Students in classrooms with less authoritative climates were victimized to a higher degree. Thus, the current findings suggest that a warm, caring, supportive, controlled, demanding, and cohesive classroom climate should be considered a vital protective factor against bullying victimization and negative bystander responses, and a facilitator of defending and supporting victims.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019-01-02","2019-01-02","2023-06-02","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1274630/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","3","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

By fitting a model to the dMRI signal it is possible to derive various quantitative features. Several of the most popular dMRI signal models are expansions in an appropriately chosen basis, where the coefficients are determined using some variation of least-squares. However, such approaches lack any notion of uncertainty, which could be valuable in e.g. group analyses. In this work, we use a probabilistic interpretation of linear least-squares methods to recast popular dMRI models as Bayesian ones. This makes it possible to quantify the uncertainty of any derived quantity. In particular, for quantities that are affine functions of the coefficients, the posterior distribution can be expressed in closed-form. We simulated measurements from single- and double-tensor models where the correct values of several quantities are known, to validate that the theoretically derived quantiles agree with those observed empirically. We included results from residual bootstrap for comparison and found good agreement. The validation employed several different models: Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), Mean Apparent Propagator MRI (MAP-MRI) and Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD). We also used in vivo data to visualize maps of quantitative features and corresponding uncertainties, and to show how our approach can be used in a group analysis to downweight subjects with high uncertainty. In summary, we convert successful linear models for dMRI signal estimation to probabilistic models, capable of accurate uncertainty quantification.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018-04-12","2018-04-12","2024-01-10","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1197124/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","6","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-144351","","","","","false","","",""

The variance and confidence bounds of the approximations can be precisely estimated without additional computational costs. Furthermore, a method that iterates over subdomains is introduced, and is shown to additionally reduce the approximation errors to practically negligible levels in an application on functional magnetic resonance imaging data.

In the continuous branch case we suggest approximations to the limit distribution. We propose heuristic methods of simulating from these distributions and it may be observed that these algorithms result in reasonable tails. Therefore, we propose a way based on the quantiles of the derived distributions for hypothesis testing, whether an observed phylogenetic tree is consistent with the pure-birth process. Simulating a sample by the proposed heuristics is rapid, while exact simulation (simulating the tree and then calculating the index) is a time-consuming procedure.

The clinical phase of inflammatory diseases is often the culmination of a long series of pathologic events that started years before. The systemic characteristics and related mechanisms could be investigated through the multi-omic comparative analysis of many inflammatory diseases. Therefore, it is important to use molecular data to study the genesis of the diseases. Here we propose a new methodology to study the relationships between inflammatory diseases and signalling molecules whose dysregulation at molecular levels could lead to systemic pathological events observed in inflammatory diseases.ResultsWe first perform an exploratory analysis of gene expression data of a number of diseases that involve a strong inflammatory component. The comparison of gene expression between disease and healthy samples reveals the importance of members of gene families coding for signalling factors. Next, we focus on interested signalling gene families and a subset of inflammation related diseases with multi-omic features including both gene expression and DNA methylation. We introduce a phylogenetic-based multi-omic method to study the relationships between multi-omic features of inflammation related diseases by integrating gene expression, DNA methylation through sequence based phylogeny of the signalling gene families. The models of adaptations between gene expression and DNA methylation can be inferred from pre-estimated evolutionary relationship of a gene family. Members of the gene family whose expression or methylation levels significantly deviate from the model are considered as the potential disease associated genes.ConclusionsApplying the methodology to four gene families (the chemokine receptor family, the TNF receptor family, the TGF- gene family, the IL-17 gene family) in nine inflammation related diseases, we identify disease associated genes which exhibit significant dysregulation in gene expression or DNA methylation in the inflammation related diseases, which provides clues for functional associations between the diseases.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018-12-20","2018-12-20","2024-01-17","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1273242/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","3","","deprecated","","","12th International BBCC Conference","","439","false","","",""

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2009) for causal effect identification. Recently, alternative acyclic directed mixed graphs (aADMGs) have been proposed by Peña (Proceedings of the 32nd conference on uncertainty in artificial intelligence, 577–586, 2016) for causal effect identification in domains with additive noise. Since the ADMG and the aADMG of the domain at hand may encode different model assumptions, it may be that the causal effect of interest is identifiable in one but not in the other. Causal effect identification in ADMGs is well understood. In this paper, we introduce a sound algorithm for identifying arbitrary causal effects from aADMGs. We show that the algorithm follows from a calculus similar to Pearl’s do-calculus. Then, we turn our attention to Andersson–Madigan–Perlman chain graphs, which are a subclass of aADMGs, and propose a factorization for the positive discrete probability distributions that are Markovian with respect to these chain graphs. We also develop an algorithm to perform maximum likelihood estimation of the factors in the factorization.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019-08-08","2019-08-08","2019-11-15","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1341382/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","1","","deprecated","","","","","","true","","",""

The definition of population is critical but often nontrivial. There are many different sampling strategies available. The theoretically simplest scheme is simple random sampling and that can be used to provide estimates of the mean and standard deviation. More precise estimates can be obtained using stratified sampling. Cluster sampling is useful when there is significant travel time between the sampling units—however, except in simple cases, estimation of the mean and standard error requires expert input. Systematic sampling is simple to apply and gives precise estimates of the mean. Good estimates of the standard error are not available, but there are useful approximations.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019-08-12","2019-08-12","2019-12-19","","","2","","deprecated","","","","","","true","","",""

In particular, we propose and compare two different strategies for sampling the parameter block with latent topic indicators. The experiments show that the increase in statistical inefficiency from only partial collapsing is smaller than commonly assumed, and can be more than compensated by the speedup from parallelization and sparsity on larger corpora.

One solution has been proposed to speed up the algorithm by a delayed acceptance approach where the acceptance decision proceeds in two stages. In the first stage, an estimate of the likelihood based on a random subsample determines if it is likely that the draw will be accepted and, if so, the second stage uses the full data likelihood to decide upon final acceptance. Evaluating the full data likelihood is thus avoided for draws that are unlikely to be accepted. We propose a more precise likelihood estimator that incorporates auxiliary information about the full data likelihood while only operating on a sparse set of the data. We prove that the resulting delayed acceptance MH is more efficient. The caveat of this approach is that the full dataset needs to be evaluated in the second stage. We therefore propose to substitute this evaluation by an estimate and construct a state-dependent approximation thereof to use in the first stage.

The model is based on the RuleFit approach in Friedman and Popescu [Ann. Appl. Stat. 2 (2008) 916-954] where rules from decision trees and linear terms are used in a Ll -regularized regression. We modify RuleFit by replacing the L1-regularization by a horseshoe prior, which is well known to give aggressive shrinkage of noise predictors while leaving the important signal essentially untouched. This is especially important when a large number of rules are used as predictors as many of them only contribute noise. Our horseshoe prior has an additional hierarchical layer that applies more shrinkage a priori to rules with a large number of splits, and to rules that are only satisfied by a few observations. The aggressive noise shrinkage of our prior also makes it possible to complement the rules from boosting in RuleFit with an additional set of trees from Random Forest, which brings a desirable diversity to the ensemble. We sample from the posterior distribution using a very efficient and easily implemented Gibbs sampler. The new model is shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods like RuleFit, BART and Random Forest on 16 datasets. The model and its interpretation is demonstrated on the well known Boston housing data, and on gene expression data for cancer classification. The posterior sampling, prediction and graphical tools for interpreting the model results are implemented in a publicly available R package.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018-12-01","2018-12-01","2018-12-01","","","2","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

However, a known drawback of this method is that its fitted response is a piecewise constant function, while practical response functions are often required to be continuous. The method proposed in this paper achieves monotonicity and smoothness of the regression by introducing an <em>L</em><sub>2</sub> regularization term. In order to achieve a low computational complexity and at the same time to provide a high predictive power of the method, we introduce a probabilistically motivated approach for selecting the regularization parameters. In addition, we present a technique for correcting inconsistencies on the boundary. We show that the complexity of the proposed method is <em>O</em>(<em>n</em><sup><em>2</em></sup>). Our simulations demonstrate that when the data are large and the expected response is a complicated function (which is typical in machine learning applications) or when there is a change point in the response, the proposed method has a higher predictive power than many of the existing methods.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018-04-27","2018-04-27","2019-04-03","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1202548/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","2","","deprecated","","","","","","true","true","",""

Such analyses depend crucially on the underlying model. Gaussian phylogenetic models like Brownian motion and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes are the workhorses of modeling continuous-trait evolution. However, these models fit poorly to big trees, because they neglect the heterogeneity of the evolutionary process in different lineages of the tree. Previous works have addressed this issue by introducing shifts in the evolutionary model occurring at inferred points in the tree. However, for computational reasons, in all current implementations, these shifts are ""intramodel,"" meaning that they allow jumps in 1 or 2 model parameters, keeping all other parameters ""global"" for the entire tree. There is no biological reason to restrict a shift to a single model parameter or, even, to a single type of model. Mixed Gaussian phylogenetic models (MGPMs) incorporate the idea of jointly inferring different types of Gaussian models associated with different parts of the tree. Here, we propose an approximate maximum-likelihood method for fitting MGPMs to comparative data comprising possibly incomplete measurements for several traits from extant and extinct phylogenetically linked species.

However, questions regarding the nature of the relationship between these two disease entities remain. We evaluated the strength of associations for the bidirectional relationships between EDs and autoimmune diseases. Methods In this nationwide population-based study, Swedish registers were linked to establish a cohort of more than 2.5 million individuals born in Sweden between January 1, 1979 and December 31, 2005 and followed up until December 2013. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to investigate: (a) subsequent risk of EDs in individuals with autoimmune diseases; and (b) subsequent risk of autoimmune diseases in individuals with EDs. Results We observed a strong, bidirectional relationship between the two illness classes indicating that diagnosis in one illness class increased the risk of the other. In women, the diagnoses of autoimmune disease increased subsequent hazards of anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and other eating disorders (OED). Similarly, AN, BN, and OED increased subsequent hazards of autoimmune diseases.Gastrointestinal-related autoimmune diseases such as, celiac disease and Crohns disease showed a bidirectional relationship with AN and OED. Psoriasis showed a bidirectional relationship with OED. The previous occurence of type 1 diabetes increased the risk for AN, BN, and OED. In men, we did not observe a bidirectional pattern, but prior autoimmune arthritis increased the risk for OED. Conclusions The interactions between EDs and autoimmune diseases support the previously reported associations. The bidirectional risk pattern observed in women suggests either a shared mechanism or a third mediating variable contributing to the association of these illnesses.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019-07-20","2019-07-20","2023-08-28","","","12","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

We address issues about the particular event‐related designs we used, considering multiple event types and randomization of events between subjects. We consider the lack of validity found with one‐sample permutation (sign flipping) tests, investigating a number of approaches to improve the false positive control of this widely used procedure. We found that the combination of a two‐sided test and cleaning the data using ICA FIX resulted in nominal false positive rates for all data sets, meaning that data cleaning is not only important for resting state fMRI, but also for task fMRI. Finally, we discuss the implications of our work on the fMRI literature as a whole, estimating that at least 10% of the fMRI studies have used the most problematic cluster inference method (<em>p</em> = .01 cluster defining threshold), and how individual studies can be interpreted in light of our findings.

This is the fundamental problem of Bayesian statistics and machine learning, which frames all inference as expectations with respect to the posterior distribution. The key challenge is to approximate these intractable expectations. In this tutorial, we review sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), a random-sampling-based class of methods for approximate inference. First, we explain the basics of SMC, discuss practical issues, and review theoretical results. We then examine two of the main user design choices: the proposal distributions and the so called intermediate target distributions. We review recent results on how variational inference and amortization can be used to learn efficient proposals and target distributions. Next, we discuss the SMC estimate of the normalizing constant, how this can be used for pseudo-marginal inference and inference evaluation. Throughout the tutorial we illustrate the use of SMC on various models commonly used in machine learning, such as stochastic recurrent neural networks, probabilistic graphical models, and probabilistic programs.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-03-23","2020-03-23","2020-06-02","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1416453/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","3","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

Here, we argue that phylogenomics stands to benefit by embracing the many heterogeneous genomic signals emerging from the first decade of large-scale phylogenetic analysis spawned by high-throughput sequencing (HTS). Such signals include those most commonly encountered in phylogenomic datasets, such as incomplete lineage sorting, but also those reticulate processes emerging with greater frequency, such as recombination and introgression. Here we focus specifically on how phylogenetic methods can accommodate the heterogeneity incurred by such population genetic processes; we do not discuss phylogenetic methods that ignore such processes, such as concatenation or supermatrix approaches or supertrees. We suggest that methods of data acquisition and the types of markers used in phylogenomics will remain restricted until a posteriori methods of marker choice are made possible with routine whole-genome sequencing of taxa of interest. We discuss limitations and potential extensions of a model supporting innovation in phylogenomics today, the multispecies coalescent model (MSC). Macroevolutionary models that use phylogenies, such as character mapping, often ignore the heterogeneity on which building phylogenies increasingly rely and suggest that assimilating such heterogeneity is an important goal moving forward. Finally, we argue that an integrative cyberinfrastructure linking all steps of the process of building the ToL, from specimen acquisition in the field to publication and tracking of phylogenomic data, as well as a culture that values contributors at each step, are essential for progress.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019-03-20","2019-03-20","2023-08-28","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1297526/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","20","","deprecated","","","","","e6399","false","","",""

In safetycritical applications, it is pivotal for a model to possess an adequate sense of uncertainty, which for probabilistic classifiers translates into outputting probability distributions that are consistent with the empirical frequencies observed from realized outcomes. A classifier with such a property is called calibrated. In this work, we develop a general theoretical calibration evaluation framework grounded in probability theory, and point out subtleties present in model calibration evaluation that lead to refined interpretations of existing evaluation techniques. Lastly, we propose new ways to quantify and visualize miscalibration in probabilistic classification, including novel multidimensional reliability diagrams.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-03-11","2019-08-09","2021-07-13","","Stiftelsen för strategisk forskning (SSF) [ICA16-0015];Vetenskapsrådet [2016-04278]","6","","deprecated","","publishedPaper","22nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, Naha, Okinawa, Japan, 16-18 April 2019","","","true","","",""

Correction strategies involve three classes of methods: registration to a structural image, the use of a fieldmap, or the use of images acquired with opposing phase encoding directions. It has been demonstrated that phase encoding based methods outperform the other two classes, but unfortunately, the choice of which phase encoding based method to use is still an open question due to the absence of any systematic comparisons.</p><p><strong>Methods:</strong> In this paper we quantitatively evaluated six popular phase encoding based methods for correcting susceptibility distortions in diffusion MRI data. We employed a framework that allows for the simulation of realistic diffusion MRI data with susceptibility distortions. We evaluated the ability for methods to correct distortions by comparing the corrected data with the ground truth. Four diffusion tensor metrics (FA, MD, eigenvalues and eigenvectors) were calculated from the corrected data and compared with the ground truth. We also validated two popular indirect metrics using both simulated data and real data. The two indirect metrics are the difference between the corrected LR and AP data, and the FA standard deviation over the corrected LR, RL, AP, and PA data.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> We found that <em>DR-BUDDI</em> and <em>TOPUP</em> offered the most accurate and robust correction compared to the other four methods using both direct and indirect evaluation metrics. <em>EPIC</em> and <em>HySCO</em> performed well in correcting <em>b</em>0 images but produced poor corrections for diffusion weighted volumes, and also they produced large errors for the four diffusion tensor metrics. We also demonstrate that the indirect metric (the difference between corrected LR and AP data) gives a different ordering of correction quality than the direct metric.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> We suggest researchers to use <em>DR-BUDDI</em> or <em>TOPUP</em> for susceptibility distortion correction. The two indirect metrics (the difference between corrected LR and AP data, and the FA standard deviation) should be interpreted together as a measure of distortion correction quality. The performance ranking of the various tools inferred from direct and indirect metrics differs slightly. However, across all tools, the results of direct and indirect metrics are highly correlated indicating that the analysis of indirect metrics may provide a good proxy of the performance of a correction tool if assessment using direct metrics is not feasible.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019-12-12","2019-12-12","2024-01-17","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1377532/FULLTEXT01.pdf","Vetenskapsrådet [2017-04889];Vinnova","2","","deprecated","","","","","76","true","true","",""

The iterations make HMC computationally costly, especially in problems with large data sets, since it is necessary to compute posterior densities and their derivatives with respect to the parameters. Naively computing the Hamiltonian dynamics on a subset of the data causes HMC to lose its key ability to generate distant parameter proposals with high acceptance probability. The key insight in our article is that efficient subsampling HMC for the parameters is possible if both the dynamics and the acceptance probability are computed from the same data subsample in each complete HMC iteration. We show that this is possible to do in a principled way in a HMC-within-Gibbs framework where the subsample is updated using a pseudo marginal MH step and the parameters are then updated using an HMC step, based on the current subsample. We show that our subsampling methods are fast and compare favorably to two popular sampling algorithms that use gradient estimates from data subsampling. We also explore the current limitations of subsampling HMC algorithms by varying the quality of the variance reducing control variates used in the estimators of the posterior density and its gradients.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019-08-06","2019-08-06","2019-11-14","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1340870/FULLTEXT02.pdf","","5","","deprecated","","","","","1","true","","",""

A viable approach is particle Markov chain Monte Carlo, combining MCMC and sequential Monte Carlo to form ""exact approximations"" to otherwise intractable MCMC methods. The performance of the approximation is limited to that of the exact method. We focus on particle Gibbs and particle Gibbs with ancestor sampling, improving their performance beyond that of the underlying Gibbs sampler (which they approximate) by marginalizing out one or more parameters. This is possible when the parameter prior is conjugate to the complete data likelihood. Marginalization yields a non-Markovian model for inference, but we show that, in contrast to the general case, this method still scales linearly in time. While marginalization can be cumbersome to implement, recent advances in probabilistic programming have enabled its automation. We demonstrate how the marginalized methods are viable as efficient inference backends in probabilistic programming, and demonstrate with examples in ecology and epidemiology.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-07-20","2020-07-20","2020-07-20","","","4","","deprecated","","publishedPaper","33rd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)","","","false","","",""

Most approaches to training the model rely on iterative algorithms, which makes it difficult to run LDA on big corpora that are best analyzed in parallel and distributed computational environments. Indeed, current approaches to parallel inference either dont converge to the correct posterior or require storage of large dense matrices in memory. We present a novel sampler that overcomes both problems, and we show that this sampler is faster, both empirically and theoretically, than previous Gibbs samplers for LDA. We do so by employing a novel Polya-urn-based approximation in the sparse partially collapsed sampler for LDA. We prove that the approximation error vanishes with data size, making our algorithm asymptotically exact, a property of importance for large-scale topic models. In addition, we show, via an explicit example, that-contrary to popular belief in the topic modeling literature-partially collapsed samplers can be more efficient than fully collapsed samplers.

The results were further strengthened by the validation using Conditional random forest modeling showing the same variables being important as predicting the outcome in the CI tree analysis. As assets can be a result, rather than a predictor of more affluence our results in summary point specifically to the importance of education and participation in the water installation intervention as predictors for more affluence.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Predictors of poverty are useful for directing interventions and in the Cuatro Santos area education seems most important to prioritize.

It has been shown in the literature that these methods can lead to great improvements in medicine compared to traditional methods prescribing the same treatment to all patients. Subgroup identification is a branch of personalized medicine, which aims at finding subgroups of the patients with similar characteristics for which some of the investigated treatments have a better effect than the other treatments. A number of approaches based on decision trees have been proposed to identify such subgroups, but most of them focus on two‐arm trials (control/treatment) while a few methods consider quantitative treatments (defined by the dose). However, no subgroup identification method exists that can predict the best treatments in a scenario with a categorical set of treatments. We propose a novel method for subgroup identification in categorical treatment scenarios. This method outputs a decision tree showing the probabilities of a given treatment being the best for a given group of patients as well as labels showing the possible best treatments. The method is implemented in an R package psica available on CRAN. In addition to a simulation study, we present an analysis of a community‐based nutrition intervention trial that justifies the validity of our method.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019-08-06","2019-08-06","2020-01-29","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1340796/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","4","","deprecated","","","","","","true","true","",""

The likelihood estimate is bias-corrected and used in two dependent pseudo-marginal algorithms to sample from a perturbed posterior, for which we derive the asymptotic error with respect to n and m, respectively. We propose a practical estimator of the error and show that the error is negligible even for a very small m in our applications.

Sex, phylogeny, and tolerance indicated by other symbionts (e.g., endosymbionts) or simply is it related to local habitat, especially if the gut biome is considered? To answer these questions, we investigated the gut microbial profile of both sexes of three Unio crassus populations, species with unique system of mitochondrial DNA inheritance called doubly uniparental inheritance (DUI), living in different ecological conditions. High-throughput sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable regions in the bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragment was performed, which resulted in a total of 1,051,647 reads, with 58,424 reads/65 OTUs (operational taxonomic units) per sample on average. We identified a core microbiome, with all individual mussels sharing 69 OTUs (representing 23% of the total number of OTUs). Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in all samples, followed by Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. There were no significant differences in gut microbiome compositions between the two sexes of this species; however, we observed different phyla in geographically isolated populations. A non-metric multidimensional scaling plot and dendrogram showed that the bacterial profile complies with the genetic structure of populations. Although we found differences in microbiomes between populations, their genetic structure suggests that the microbiome is weakly related to habitat, and more strongly to phylogeography (on both F and M mitotypes). We found no significant differences in beta diversity between the individuals of the bacterial communities measured using the Bray-Curtis index. Finally, we also examined whether OTUs were represented by symbiotic bacteria that enable cellulose digestion and by endosymbiotic bacteria that play important functions in the biology of their hosts and also affect microevolutionary processes and population phenomena. With regard to the endosymbionts, however, there was no relation to sex of the studied individuals, which suggests that there are no straightforward relations between DUI and microbiome.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-03-27","2020-03-27","2022-09-29","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1417320/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","6","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

Unfortunately, standard distillation erases the natural uncertainty decomposition of the ensemble. We present a general framework for distilling both regression and classification ensembles in a way that preserves the decomposition.

We analyzed gene expression profiling data to find explanations for this. Methods:We analyzed mRNA expression profiling data, GSE36830, of six uncinate tissues from healthy controls and six NP from CRSwNP patients. We performed Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of differentially expressed genes to identify pathways and predicted upstream regulators. Results: We identified 1,608 differentially expressed genes and 177 significant pathways, of which Th1 and Th2 activation pathway and leukocyte extravasation signaling were most significant. We identified 75 upstream regulators whose activity was predicted to be upregulated.These included regulators of known pathogenic and therapeutic relevance, like IL-4. However, only seven of the 75 regulators were actually differentially expressed in NP, namely CSF1, TYROBP, CCL2, CCL11, SELP, ADORA3, ICAM1. Interestingly, these did not include IL-4, and four of the seven were receptors. This suggested a potential explanation for the discrepancy between the predicted and observed expression levels of the regulators, namely that the receptors, and not their ligands, were upregulated. Indeed, we found that 10 receptors of key predicted upstream regulators were upregulated, including IL4R. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that the difficulties in finding specific biomarkers for CRSwNP depend on the complex underlying mechanisms, which include multiple pathways and regulators, each of which may be subdivided into multiple components such as ligands, soluble and membrane-bound receptors. This suggests that combinations of biomarkers may be needed for CRSwNP diagnostics.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-09-12","2020-09-12","2021-12-28","","","8","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

Focusing on Italy, one of the hardest hit countries, we look at how these two values could be put in perspective to reflect the dynamics of the virus spread. In particular, we find that merely considering the confirmed case counts would be very misleading. The number of daily tests grows, while the daily fraction of confirmed cases to total tests has a change point. It (depending on region) generally increases with strong fluctuations till (around, depending on region) 15-22 March and then decreases linearly after. Combined with the increasing trend of daily performed tests, the raw confirmed case counts are not representative of the situation and are confounded with the sampling effort. This we observe when regressing on time the logged fraction of positive tests and for comparison the logged raw confirmed count. Hence, calibrating model parameters for this viruss dynamics should not be done based only on confirmed case counts (without rescaling by the number of tests), but take also fatalities and hospitalization count under consideration as variables not prone to be distorted by testing efforts. Furthermore, reporting statistics on the national level does not say much about the dynamics of the disease, which are taking place at the regional level. These findings are based on the official data of total death counts up to 15 April 2020 released by ISTAT and up to 10 May 2020 for the number of cases. In this work, we do not fit models but we rather investigate whether this task is possible at all.

Four municipalities in northern Nicaragua constitute the Cuatro Santos area, with 25,893 inhabitants in 5,966 households (2014). A local process analyzing poverty-related problems, prioritizing suggested actions, was initiated in 1997 and generated a community action plan 2002-2015. Interventions were school breakfasts, environmental protection, water and sanitation, preventive healthcare, home gardening, microcredit, technical training, university education stipends, and use of the Internet. In 2004, a survey of basic health and demographic information was performed in the whole population, followed by surveillance updates in 2007, 2009, and 2014 linking households and individuals. Information included the house material (floor, walls) and services (water, sanitation, electricity) as well as demographic data (birth, deaths, migration). Data on participation in interventions, food security, household assets, and womens self-rated health were collected in 2014. A K-means algorithm was used to cluster the household data (56 variables) in six clusters. The poverty ranking of household clusters using the unsatisfied basic needs index variables changed when including variables describing basic capabilities. The households in the fairly rich cluster with assets such as motorbikes and computers were described as modern. Those in the fairly poor cluster, having different degrees of food insecurity, were labeled vulnerable. Poor and poorest clusters of households were traditional, e.g., in using horses for transport. Results displayed a society transforming from traditional to modern, where the forerunners were not the richest but educated, had more working members in household, had fewer children, and were food secure. Those lagging were the poor, traditional, and food insecure. The approach may be useful for an improved understanding of poverty and to direct local policy and interventions.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-03-11","2020-03-11","2020-04-02","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1413996/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","8","","deprecated","","","","","409","true","true","",""

Common GMRFs are special cases of a generative model where the inverse mapping from data to latent variables is given by a 1-layer linear CNN. This connection allows us to generalize GMRFs to multi-layer CNN architectures, effectively increasing the order of the corresponding GMRF in a way which has favorable computational scaling. We describe how well-established tools, such as autodiff and variational inference, can be used for simple and efficient inference and learning of the deep GMRF.

The test statistics are constructed as sup-functionals of weighted empirical processes where the weight functions employed are the Chibisov-O’Reilly functions of a Brownian bridge. The study recovers and extends a number of previously known results on sparse detection using a weighted GOF (wGOF) approach. In particular, the results obtained demonstrate the advantage of our approach over a common approach that utilizes a family of regularly varying weight functions. We show that the Chibisov-O’Reilly family has important advantages over better known approaches as it allows for optimally adaptive, fully data-driven test procedures. The theory is further developed to demonstrate that the entire family is a flexible device that adapts to many interesting situations of modern scientific practice where the number of observations stays fixed or grows very slowly while the number of automatically measured features grows dramatically and only a small fraction of these features are useful. Numerical studies are performed to investigate the finite sample properties of the theoretical results. We shown that the Chibisov-O’Reilly family compares favorably to related test statistics over a broad range of sparsity and weakness regimes for the Gaussian and high-dimensional Dirichlet types of sparse mixture. Finally, an example of human gut microbiome data set is presented to illustrate that the family of tests has found applications in real-life sparse signal detection problems where the sample size is small in relation to the features dimension.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-03","2022-10-03","2022-12-20","","","4","","deprecated","","","","","","true","","",""

A common approach has been to assume a Gaussian phylogenetic model for the trait evolution along the tree, such as a branching Brownian motion (BM) or an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. Then, the parameters of the process have been inferred based on a given tree and trait data for the sampled species. At the heart of this inference lie multiple calculations of the model likelihood, that is, the probability density of the observed trait data, conditional on the model parameters and the tree. With the increasing availability of big phylogenetic trees, spanning hundreds to several thousand sampled species, this approach is facing a two-fold challenge. First, the assumption of a single Gaussian process governing the entire tree is not adequate in the presence of heterogeneous evolutionary forces acting in different parts of the tree. Second, big trees present a computational challenge, due to the time and memory complexity of the model likelihood calculation. Here, we explore a sub-family, denoted G(LInv) , of the Gaussian phylogenetic models, with the transition density exhibiting the properties that the expectation depends Linearly on the ancestral trait value and the variance is Invariant with respect to the ancestral value. We show that G(LInv), contains the vast majority of Gaussian models currently used in PCMs, while supporting an efficient (linear in the number of nodes) algorithm for the likelihood calculation. The algorithm supports scenarios with missing data, as well as different types of trees, including trees with polytomies and non-ultrametric trees. To account for the heterogeneity in the evolutionary forces, the algorithm supports models with ""shifts"" occurring at specific points in the tree. Such shifts can include changes in some or all parameters, as well as the type of the model, provided that the model remains within the G(LInv) family. This contrasts with most of the current implementations where, due to slow likelihood calculation, the shifts are restricted to specific parameters in a single type of model, such as the long-term selection optima of an OU process, assuming that all of its other parameters, such as evolutionary rate and selection strength, are global for the entire tree. We provide an implementation of this likelihood calculation algorithm in an accompanying R-package called PCMBase.

Recent results have provided evidence of the functional significance of the white matter BOLD signal, showing at the same time that its correlation structure is highly anisotropic, and related to the diffusion tensor in shape and orientation. This evidence suggests that conventional isotropic Gaussian filters are inadequate for denoising white matter fMRI data, since they are incapable of adapting to the complex anisotropic domain of white matter axonal connections. In this paper we explore a graph-based description of the white matter developed from diffusion MRI data, which is capable of encoding the anisotropy of the domain. Based on this representation we design localized spatial filters that adapt to white matter structure by leveraging graph signal processing principles. The performance of the proposed filtering technique is evaluated on semi-synthetic data, where it shows potential for greater sensitivity and specificity in white matter activation mapping, compared to isotropic filtering.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-05-29","2020-05-29","2020-10-31","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1433272/FULLTEXT01.pdf","Vetenskapsrådet [2017- 04889];Vetenskapsrådet [2018-06689]","4","","deprecated","","publishedPaper","IEEE 17th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI), Iowa City, IA, USA, 3-7 April 2020","","","true","","",""

VI posits a family of approximating distributions q and then finds the member of that family that is closest to the exact posterior p. Traditionally, VI algorithms minimize the “exclusive Kullback-Leibler (KL)” KL(q||p), often for computational convenience. Recent research, however, has also focused on the “inclusive KL” KL(p||q), which has good statistical properties that makes it more appropriate for certain inference problems. This paper develops a simple algorithm for reliably minimizing the inclusive KL using stochastic gradients with vanishing bias. This method, which we call Markovian score climbing (MSC), converges to a local optimum of the inclusive KL. It does not suffer from the systematic errors inherent in existing methods, such as Reweighted Wake-Sleep and Neural Adaptive Sequential Monte Carlo, which lead to bias in their final estimates. We illustrate convergence on a toy model and demonstrate the utility of MSC on Bayesian probit regression for classification as well as a stochastic volatility model for financial data.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-05","2022-04-05","2022-04-05","","Vetenskapsrådet [2016-04278];Stiftelsen för strategisk forskning (SSF) [ICA16- 0015];Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)","3","","deprecated","","publishedPaper","Neural Information Processing Systems","","","false","true","",""

Multivariate multiple regression analyses showed that indirect bullying was predicted by gender and victim attribution. Direct bullying was predicted by moral justification, and for girls, by victim attribution. Pro-aggressive bystander behavior was predicted by diffusion of responsibility, victim attribution, gender, and age. That is, boys and younger students were more prone to take the aggressor’s side compared with girls and older students. Furthermore, the relation between pro-aggressive bystander behavior and distortion of consequences appeared stronger in boys than in girls. These results highlight the relative importance of specific moral disengagement mechanisms and may have implications for interventions targeting bullying.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019-08-15","2019-08-15","2023-06-02","","","4","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-181739","","","","","true","","",""

Results: Of 49,985 patients with HF (anemia = 34%), 23% had HFpEF (anemia = 41%), 21% had HFmrEF (anemia = 35%) and 55% had HFpEF (anemia = 32%). Higher EF was independently associated with higher likelihood of concomitant anemia. Important predictors of anemia across the EF spectrum were male sex, older age, worse New York Heart Association class and renal function, lower systolic blood pressure, higher N-Terminal B-type natriuretic peptides levels, diabetes, valvular disease and in-patient status. Anemia had adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI) for mortality or HF hospitalization 1.24 (1.18-1.30) in HFpEF, 1.26 (1.19-1.34) in HFmrEF and 1.14 (1.10-1.19) in HFrEF; p(interaction)EF = 0.003; and for mortality 1.28 (1.20-1.36) in HFpEF, 1.21 (1.13-1.29) in HFmrEF, and 1.30 (1.24-1.35) in HFrEF; p(interaction)EF = 0.22. Conclusions: In this nation-wide registry, prevalence of anemia was higher in HFpEF vs. HFmrEF vs. HFrEF, but was associated with a similarly increased risk of death across the EF spectrum, with greater risk of death or HF hospitalization in HFpEF and HFmrEF vs. HFrEF.

Traditional approaches typically search an area exhaustively, thereby ignoring that the density of victims varies based on predictable factors, such as the terrain, population density and the type of disaster. We present a probabilistic model to automate SAR planning, with explicit minimization of the expected time to discovery. The proposed model is a spatial point process with three interacting spatial fields for i) the point patterns of persons in the area, ii) the probability of detecting persons and iii) the probability of injury. This structure allows inclusion of informative priors from e.g. geographic or cell phone traffic data, while falling back to latent Gaussian processes when priors are missing or inaccurate. To solve this problem in real-time, we propose a combination of fast approximate inference using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA), and a novel Monte Carlo tree search tailored to the problem. Experiments using data simulated from real world Geographic Information System (GIS) maps show that the framework outperforms competing approaches, finding many more injured in the crucial first hours.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019-08-19","2019-08-19","2023-04-05","","","5","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-163419;urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-165872","publishedPaper","Proceedings of the 35th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI 2019), Tel Aviv, Israel, July 22-25, 2019","","","true","","",""

Failing to properly account for spatial autocorrelation may often lead to false conclusions. At the same time, the ever-increasing sizes of spatial datasets pose a great computational challenge, as many standard methods for spatial analysis are limited to a few thousand data points.</p><p>In this thesis, we explore how Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) can be used for scalable analysis of spatial data. GMRFs are closely connected to the commonly used Gaussian processes, but have sparsity properties that make them computationally cheap both in time and memory. The Bayesian framework enables a GMRF to be used as a spatial prior, comprising the assumption of smooth variation over space, and gives a principled way to estimate the parameters and propagate uncertainty.</p><p>We develop new algorithms that enable applying GMRF priors in 3D to the brain activity inherent in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, with millions of observations. We show that our methods are both faster and more accurate than previous work. A method for approximating selected elements of the inverse precision matrix (i.e. the covariance matrix) is also proposed, which is important for evaluating the posterior uncertainty. In addition, we establish a link between GMRFs and deep convolutional neural networks, which have been successfully used in countless machine learning tasks for images, resulting in a deep GMRF model. Finally, we show how GMRFs can be used in real-time robotic search and rescue operations, for modeling the spatial distribution of injured persons.</p>;<p>Tillförlitlig statistisk analys av spatiala data är viktigt inom många tillämpningar. Om inte korrekt hänsyn tas till spatial autokorrelation kan det ofta leda till felaktiga slutsatser. Samtidigt ökar ständigt storleken på de spatiala datamaterialen vilket utgör en stor beräkningsmässig utmaning, eftersom många standardmetoder för spatial analys är begränsade till några tusental datapunkter.</p><p>I denna avhandling utforskar vi hur Gaussiska Markov-fält (eng: Gaussian Markov random fields, GMRF) kan användas för mer skalbara analyser av spatiala data. GMRF-modeller är nära besläktade med de ofta använda Gaussiska processerna, men har gleshetsegenskaper som gör dem beräkningsmässigt effektiva både vad gäller tids- och minnesåtgång. Det Bayesianska synsättet gör det möjligt att använda GMRF som en spatial prior som innefattar antagandet om långsam spatial variation och ger ett principiellt tillvägagångssätt för att skatta parametrar och propagera osäkerhet.</p><p>Vi utvecklar nya algoritmer som gör det möjligt att använda GMRF-priors i 3D för den hjärnaktivitet som indirekt kan observeras i hjärnbilder framtagna med tekniken fMRI, som innehåller milliontals datapunkter. Vi visar att våra metoder är både snabbare och mer korrekta än tidigare forskning. En metod för att approximera utvalda element i den inversa precisionsmatrisen (dvs. kovariansmatrisen) framförs också, vilket är viktigt för att kunna evaluera osäkerheten i posteriorn. Vidare gör vi en koppling mellan GMRF och djupa neurala faltningsnätverk, som har använts framgångsrikt för mängder av bildrelaterade problem inom maskininlärning, vilket mynnar ut i en djup GMRF-modell. Slutligen visar vi hur GMRF kan användas i realtid av autonoma drönare för räddningsinsatser i katastrofområden för att modellera den spatiala fördelningen av skadade personer.</p>","Rue, Håvard, Professor","Villani, Mattias [matvi05], Professor (Linköpings universitet [276], Institutionen för datavetenskap [281], ;;;Statistik och maskininlärning [878151]) (Linköpings universitet [276], ;Filosofiska fakulteten [1750])Eklund, Anders [andek67], Associate Professor (Linköpings universitet [276], Institutionen för medicinsk teknik [286], ;;Avdelningen för medicinsk teknik [877301]) (Linköpings universitet [276], ;Tekniska fakulteten [872902]) (Linköpings universitet [276], ;;Centrum för medicinsk bildvetenskap och visualisering, CMIV [3801])","","","","","","","","Ada Lovelace, B Building, Campus Valla, Linköping","eng","2020-09-18T10:15","2020-06-01","2020-08-17","2020-11-24","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1433819/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","1","","deprecated","","","","","","true","true","",""

We propose an unbiased estimator of smoothing expectations. The lack-of-bias property has methodological benefits: independent estimators can be generated in parallel, and CI can be constructed from the central limit theorem to quantify the approximation error. To design unbiased estimators, we combine a generic debiasing technique for Markov chains, with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for smoothing. The resulting procedure is widely applicable and we show in numerical experiments that the removal of the bias comes at a manageable increase in variance. We establish the validity of the proposed estimators under mild assumptions. Numerical experiments are provided on toy models, including a setting of highly informative observations, and for a realistic Lotka-Volterra model with an intractable transition density.

Self-reported survey data were collected from 333 middle and junior high school students (10-15 years of age) from four schools in Sweden. Random intercept model analyses of factor scores revealed that, when witnessing peer victimisation, students high in moral disengagement and low in defender self-efficacy were more inclined to act as reinforcers or outsiders, and that students high in defender self-efficacy and student-teacher relationship quality were more inclined to act as defenders. Furthermore, examining these relationships within and between classes revealed that reinforcer and outsider behaviours were more common among students who, compared to their classmates, were higher in moral disengagement and lower in defender self-efficacy, whereas defending was more common among students who, compared to their classmates, were higher in defender self-efficacy.

Probabilistic predictive models address this limitation by providing probability distributions that represent a belief over plausible targets, rather than point estimates. Such models can be a valuable tool in decision-making under uncertainty, provided that the model output is meaningful and interpretable. Calibrated models guarantee that the probabilistic predictions are neither over- nor under-confident. In the machine learning literature, different measures and statistical tests have been proposed and studied for evaluating the calibration of classification models. For regression problems, however, research has been focused on a weaker condition of calibration based on predicted quantiles for real-valued targets. In this paper, we propose the first framework that unifies calibration evaluation and tests for probabilistic predictive models. It applies to any such model, including classification and regression models of arbitrary dimension. Furthermore, the framework generalizes existing measures and provides a more intuitive reformulation of a recently proposed framework for calibration in multi-class classification.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-03","2020-12-23","2023-06-19","","","3","","deprecated","","publishedPaper","International Conference on Learning Representations, Virtual conference, May 3 - May 7, 2021","","","true","true","",""

Aging is the predominant risk factor for Alzheimers disease and related dementias and for neurocognitive decline. However, aging alone cannot explain changes in the overall age-adjusted incidence of dementia. The objective of this position paper was to describe the potential for cohort and period effects in cognitive decline and incidence of dementia. Cohort effects have long been reported in demographic literature, but starting in the early 1980s researchers began reporting large historical cohort trends in cognitive function. At the same time, period effects have emerged in the form of economic factors and stressors in early and midlife that may result in reduced cognitive dysfunction. Recognizing that aging individuals today were once children and adolescents and that research has clearly noted that childhood cognitive performance are associated with old-age cognitive performance, this review proposes the need to connect these cohort effects with differences in late-life functioning.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-07","2021-10-07","2021-10-07","","","9","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

The success of deep learning for medical image analysis encourages its application on OCT thyroid images for quantitative analysis of tissue microstructure. To investigate the potential of a deep learning approach to segment the follicular structure in OCT images, a 2D U-Net was trained on b-scan OCT images acquired from ex vivo adult human thyroid samples a effected by a range of pathologies. Results on a pool of 104 annotated images showed a mean Dice score of 0.74±0.19 and 0.92±0.09 when segmenting the follicular structure and the surrounding tissue on the test dataset (n=10 images).

This unbalanced treatment has been in part due to controversies in relation to the nature of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast in WM and its detachability. However, an accumulating body of studies has provided solid evidence of the functional significance of the BOLD signal in WM and has revealed that it exhibits anisotropic spatio-temporal correlations and structure-specific fluctuations concomitant with those of the cortical BOLD signal. In this work, we present an anisotropic spatial filtering scheme for smoothing fMRI data in WM that accounts for known spatial constraints on the BOLD signal in WM. In particular, the spatial correlation structure of the BOLD signal in WM is highly anisotropic and closely linked to local axonal structure in terms of shape and orientation, suggesting that isotropic Gaussian filters conventionally used for smoothing fMRI data are inadequate for denoising the BOLD signal in WM. The fundamental element in the proposed method is a graph-based description of WM that encodes the underlying anisotropy observed across WM, derived from diffusion-weighted MRI data. Based on this representation, and leveraging graph signal processing principles, we design subject-specific spatial filters that adapt to a subject’s unique WM structure at each position in the WM that they are applied at. We use the proposed filters to spatially smooth fMRI data in WM, as an alternative to the conventional practice of using isotropic Gaussian filters.

Recently, convolutional neural networks have shown remarkable performance in the identification of tumor regions in magnetic resonance (MR) images. Context-aware artificial intelligence is an emerging concept for the development of deep learning applications for computer-aided medical image analysis. A large portion of the current research is devoted to the development of new network architectures to improve segmentation accuracy by using context-aware mechanisms. In this work, it is investigated whether or not the addition of contextual information from the brain anatomy in the form of white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) masks and probability maps improves U-Net-based brain tumor segmentation. The BraTS2020 dataset was used to train and test two standard 3D U-Net (nnU-Net) models that, in addition to the conventional MR image modalities, used the anatomical contextual information as extra channels in the form of binary masks (CIM) or probability maps (CIP). For comparison, a baseline model (BLM) that only used the conventional MR image modalities was also trained. The impact of adding contextual information was investigated in terms of overall segmentation accuracy, model training time, domain generalization, and compensation for fewer MR modalities available for each subject. Median (mean) Dice scores of 90.2 (81.9), 90.2 (81.9), and 90.0 (82.1) were obtained on the official BraTS2020 validation dataset (125 subjects) for BLM, CIM, and CIP, respectively. Results show that there is no statistically significant difference when comparing Dice scores between the baseline model and the contextual information models (p &gt; 0.05), even when comparing performances for high and low grade tumors independently. In a few low grade cases where improvement was seen, the number of false positives was reduced. Moreover, no improvements were found when considering model training time or domain generalization. Only in the case of compensation for fewer MR modalities available for each subject did the addition of anatomical contextual information significantly improve (p &lt; 0.05) the segmentation of the whole tumor. In conclusion, there is no overall significant improvement in segmentation performance when using anatomical contextual information in the form of either binary WM, GM, and CSF masks or probability maps as extra channels.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-25","2021-06-25","2022-04-05","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1573566/FULLTEXT01.pdf","Vetenskapsrådet [2018-05250];Åke Wibergs Stiftelse [M20-0031];Linköpings universitet [LiU Cancer];Vinnova [Medtech4Health, AIDA (2017-02447))];Vinnova [IMPACT (2018- 02230)]","3","","deprecated","","","","","1159","true","true","",""

Most children view bullying as wrong and recognize its harmful consequences; nevertheless, it continues to be a persistent problem within schools. Previous research has shown that childrens engagement in bullying perpetration can be influenced by multiple factors (e.g., different forms of cognitive distortions) and at different ecological levels (e.g., child, peer-group, school, and society). However, the complexity of school bullying warrants further investigation of the interplay between factors, at different levels. Grounded in social cognitive theory, which focuses on both cognitive factors and social processes, this study examined whether childrens bullying perpetration was associated with moral disengagement at the child level and with collective moral disengagement and prevalence of pro-bullying behavior at the classroom level. Cross-level interactions were also tested to examine the effects of classroom-level variables on the association between childrens tendency to morally disengage and bullying perpetration. The studys analyses were based on cross-sectional self-report questionnaire data from 1,577 Swedish fifth-grade children from 105 classrooms (53.5% girls; M-age = 11.3, SD = 0.3). Multilevel modeling techniques were used to analyze the data. The results showed that bullying perpetration was positively associated with moral disengagement at the child level and with collective moral disengagement and pro-bullying behavior at the classroom level. Furthermore, the effect of individual moral disengagement on bullying was stronger for children in classrooms with higher levels of pro-bullying behaviors. These findings further support the argument that both moral processes and behaviors within classrooms, such as collective moral disengagement and pro-bullying behavior, need to be addressed in schools preventive work against bullying.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019-08-13","2019-08-13","2023-06-02","","","4","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-181739","","","","","false","","",""

However, several recent studies have found this approach to be highly unreliable, even with invertible generative models, where computing the likelihood is feasible. In this paper, we present a different framework for generative model--based OOD detection that employs the model in constructing a new representation space, instead of using it directly in computing typicality scores, where it is emphasized that the score function should be interpretable as the similarity between the input and training data in the new space. In practice, with a focus on invertible models, we propose to extract low-dimensional features (statistics) based on the model encoder and complexity of input images, and then use a One-Class SVM to score the data. Contrary to recently proposed OOD detection methods for generative models, our method does not require computing likelihood values. Consequently, it is much faster when using invertible models with iteratively approximated likelihood (e.g. iResNet), while it still has a performance competitive with other related methods</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-03","2022-10-03","2022-11-10","","","2","","deprecated","","publishedPaper","International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), 19-26 August, 2021","","","true","true","",""

However, this is not always the case and depends on both the nature of the measurement and confounding. We describe two sets of conditions under which adjusting for a non-deferentially mismeasured proxy comes closer to the unidentifiable true average causal effect than the unadjusted or crude estimate. The first set of conditions apply when the exposure is discrete or continuous and the confounder is ordinal, and the expectation of the outcome is monotonic in the confounder for both treatment levels contrasted. The second set of conditions apply when the exposure and the confounder are categorical (nominal).

When following a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to approximate the posterior distribution in this context, one typically either uses MCMC schemes which target the joint posterior of the parameters and some auxiliary latent variables, or pseudo-marginal Metropolis-Hastings (MH) schemes. The latter mimic a MH algorithm targeting the marginal posterior of the parameters by approximating unbiasedly the intractable likelihood. However, in scenarios where the parameters and auxiliary variables are strongly correlated under the posterior and/or this posterior is multimodal, Gibbs sampling or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) will perform poorly and the pseudo-marginal MH algorithm, as any other MH scheme, will be inefficient for high-dimensional parameters. We propose here an original MCMC algorithm, termed pseudo-marginal HMC, which combines the advantages of both HMC and pseudo-marginal schemes. Specifically, the PM-HMC method is controlled by a precision parameter N, controlling the approximation of the likelihood and, for any N, it samples the marginal posterior of the parameters. Additionally, as N tends to infinity, its sample trajectories and acceptance probability converge to those of an ideal, but intractable, HMC algorithm which would have access to the intractable likelihood and its gradient.

But it has some drawbacks. On the one hand, although its minimum value is reached at the so-called maximally balanced trees, it is almost always reached also at trees that are not maximally balanced. On the other hand, its definition as a sum of absolute values of differences makes it difficult to study analytically its distribution under probabilistic models of bifurcating phylogenetic trees.

A pseudo-marginalMCMCmethod is proposed that estimates the likelihood by data subsampling using a block-Poisson estimator. The estimator is a product of Poisson estimators, allowing us to update a single block of subsample indicators in each MCMC iteration so that a desired correlation is achieved between the logs of successive likelihood estimates. This is important since pseudo-marginal MCMC with positively correlated likelihood estimates can use substantially smaller subsamples without adversely affecting the sampling efficiency. The block-Poisson estimator is unbiased but not necessarily positive, so the algorithm runs the MCMC on the absolute value of the likelihood estimator and uses an importance sampling correction to obtain consistent estimates of the posterior mean of any function of the parameters. Our article derives guidelines to select the optimal tuning parameters for our method and shows that it compares very favorably to regular MCMC without subsampling, and to two other recently proposed exact subsampling approaches in the literature.

Methods A retrospective analysis of the Cuatro Santos Northern Nicaragua Health and Demographic Surveillance 2004-2014 data on women aged 15-19 and 20-24. To calculate adolescent birth and pregnancy rates, we used the first live birth at ages 10-14 and 15-19 years reported by women aged 15-19 and 20-24 years, respectively, along with estimates of annual incidence rates reported by women aged 20-24 years. We conducted conditional inference tree analyses using 52 variables to identify characteristics associated with adolescent pregnancies. Results The number of first live births reported by women aged 20-24 years was 361 during the study period. Adolescent pregnancies and live births decreased from 2004 to 2009 and thereafter increased up to 2014. The adolescent pregnancy incidence (persons-years) trend dropped from 2001 (75.1 per 1000) to 2007 (27.2 per 1000), followed by a steep upward trend from 2007 to 2008 (19.1 per 1000) that increased in 2013 (26.5 per 1000). Associated factors with adolescent pregnancy were living in low-education households, where most adults in the household were working, and high proportion of adolescent pregnancies in the local community. Wealth was not linked to teenage pregnancies. Conclusions Interventions to prevent adolescent pregnancy are imperative and must bear into account the context that influences the culture of early motherhood and lead to socioeconomic and health gains in resource-poor settings.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","2021-12-01","2021-12-20","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1615905/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","8","","deprecated","","","","","749","false","","",""

An open-source software called SAILR was recently launched by a European Union-funded project to provide forensic practitioners with a mathematical backbone in a user-friendly graphical interface. Before presenting values produced by the software as evidence in court, the LR method must be validated. In this study, a multivariate feature-based LR method for SAILR was validated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry data from comparison of diesel oil samples. The validation strategy relied on use of specific performance characteristics (e.g., accuracy, discrimination, and calibration) and their corresponding metrics (e.g., cost of log-likelihood ratio and equal error rate). The validation also encompassed the normality assumption for within-source variation. Any deviation from the normality assumption was mitigated using Lambert W transformation of the data, which improved model performance. The LR method chosen for validation was optimized using background data, and a baseline method was simultaneously developed to provide the validation criteria. The results showed that the available data could support a trivariate (or lower) model. The LR method chosen for validation outperformed the baseline method according to the performance characteristics. Using the empirical lower and upper boundaries LR method, the output limits were determined to be 1/537 &amp;lt; LR &amp;lt; 1412. By passing the tests of normality and the validation criteria, the method was considered valid within this LR range for data of sufficient quality, and relevant to the background data set.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","2021-11-17","2021-11-17","","","2","","deprecated","","","","","100375","false","","",""

Unresolved problems include how to organize and prioritize between disease-associated changes in digital twins, on cellulome- and genome-wide scales. We present a dynamic framework that can be used to model such changes and thereby prioritize upstream regulators (URs) for biomarker- and drug discovery. Methods We started with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) as a disease model, by analyses of in vitro allergen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from SAR patients. Time-series a single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of these cells were used to construct multicellular network models (MNMs) at each time point of molecular interactions between cell types. We hypothesized that predicted molecular interactions between cell types in the MNMs could be traced to find an UR gene, at an early time point. We performed bioinformatic and functional studies of the MNMs to develop a scalable framework to prioritize UR genes. This framework was tested on a single-cell and bulk-profiling data from SAR and other inflammatory diseases. Results Our scRNA-seq-based time-series MNMs of SAR showed thousands of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across multiple cell types, which varied between time points. Instead of a single-UR gene in each MNM, we found multiple URs dispersed across the cell types. Thus, at each time point, the MNMs formed multi-directional networks. The absence of linear hierarchies and time-dependent variations in MNMs complicated the prioritization of URs. For example, the expression and functions of Th2 cytokines, which are approved drug targets in allergies, varied across cell types, and time points. Our analyses of bulk- and single-cell data from other inflammatory diseases also revealed multi-directional networks that showed stage-dependent variations. We therefore developed a quantitative approach to prioritize URs: we ranked the URs based on their predicted effects on downstream target cells. Experimental and bioinformatic analyses supported that this kind of ranking is a tractable approach for prioritizing URs. Conclusions We present a scalable framework for modeling dynamic changes in digital twins, on cellulome- and genome-wide scales, to prioritize UR genes for biomarker and drug discovery.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-16","2022-05-16","2022-09-22","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1658466/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","14","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-188712","","","","48","false","","",""

Flexible time series analysis is obtained by modeling the probability of edges between vertices through latent Gaussian processes. The models and Bayesian inference are illustrated on a sample of 10-year data from four major airlines within the US air transportation system. Results show how the estimated latent parameters from the models are related to the airlines’ connectivity dynamics, and their ability to project the multilayer graph into the future for out-of-sample full network forecasts, while stochastic blockmodeling allows for the identification of relevant communities.

(3) Results: Adolescents living in high SES neighborhoods were 80% more likely to bike or walk to school (OR = 1.80; CI: 1.01, 3.20) than adolescents living in low SES neighborhoods. Furthermore, active commuting was associated with higher consumption of fruits and vegetables (OR = 1.77; CI: 1.05, 2.97) and less consumption of junk foods (OR = 0.43; CI: 0.26, 0.71), as compared to passive commuting.

Preprocessed, analysis-ready data was made openly available. Data quality plays a key role in the analysis of dMRI. To optimize QC and scale it to this large dataset, we trained a neural network through the combination of a small data subset scored by experts and a larger set scored by community scientists. The network performs QC highly concordant with that of experts on a held out set (ROC-AUC?=?0.947). A further analysis of the neural network demonstrates that it relies on image features with relevance to QC. Altogether, this work both delivers resources to advance transdiagnostic research in brain connectivity and pediatric mental health, and establishes a novel paradigm for automated QC of large datasets.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-19","2022-10-19","2023-10-02","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1704783/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","18","","deprecated","","","","","","true","true","",""

What is unclear is if there are scenarios where adjusting for the dichotomized confounder always leads to lower bias than not adjusting. We propose several sets of conditions that characterize scenarios where one should always adjust for the dichotomized confounder to reduce bias.

In this paper, we provide a fast, reliable Variational Autoencoder framework which can handle covariate censoring in high dimensional data. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our framework compares favorably to alternative methods in terms of prediction accuracy for both the response and the covariates, while enabling estimation of the prediction uncertainties. We moreover demonstrate that the method is at least 8 times faster than the benchmark models used in this paper, and more robust to initial imputations and noise than existing models.

Some stated that the risk of miscarriage in vaccinated women was similar to historical values reported before the vaccines approval. The others stated that risk was highly above-normative in women vaccinated during the first and second trimesters. We found several problems with the statistical treatment/interpretation of the originally presented values: a substantial percentage (up to 95.6%) of missing data, an incorrect denominator used for risk estimation, and too short follow-up that disabled the evaluation of the studys endpoint in numerous participants. Eventually, the Authors published a corrigendum on September 8, 2021, and pointed to updated data.

In order to balance optimally computational speed against numerical stability, we propose to furnish a (fast) naive particle smoother, propagating recursively a sample of particles and associated smoothing statistics, with an adaptive backward-sampling-based updating rule which allows the number of (costly) backward samples to be kept at a minimum. This yields a new, function-specific additive smoothing algorithm, AdaSmooth, which is computationally fast, numerically stable and easy to implement.

The influence of historical trends and differential period-specific exposures can complicate the interpretation of biomarkers of aging and health and requires careful analysis and interpretation of aging, birth cohort, and period effects. This study evaluates the effects of aging, period, and cohort on grip strength in a population of adults and older adults. Methods We use more than 27 000 observations for individuals at least 50 years of age, born in approximately 1910-1960, from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing to examine a variety of multilevel and cross-classified modeling approaches to evaluate age, period, and cohort effects. Our results extended Hierarchical Age-Period-Cohort modeling and compared our results with a set of 9 submodels with explicit assumptions to determine the most reliable modeling approach. Results Findings suggest grip strength is primarily related to age, with minimal evidence of either period and/or cohort effects. Each years increase in a persons age was associated with a 0.40-kg decrease in grip strength, though this decline differs by gender. Conclusions We conclude that as the population ages, grip strength declines at a systematic and predictable rate equal to -0.40 kg per year (approximately -0.50 kg for men and -0.30 kg for women) in residents of England aged 50 and older. Age effects were predominant and most consistent across methodologies. While there was some evidence for cohort effects, such effects were minimal and therefore indicative that grip strength is a consistent physiological biomarker of aging.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-08","2022-03-08","2023-06-02","","","9","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

However, many of the most performant models are evaluated on large databases of computed properties of, primarily, materials with precise atomic coordinates available, and which have been experimentally synthesized, i.e., which are thermodynamically stable or metastable. These aspects provide challenges when applying such models on theoretical candidate materials, for example for materials discovery, where the coordinates are not known. To extend the scope of this methodology, we investigate the performance of the crystal graph convolutional neural network on a data set of theoretical structures in three related ternary phase diagrams (Ti,Zr,Hf)-Zn-N, which thus include many highly unstable structures. We then investigate the impact on the performance of using atomic positions that are only partially relaxed into local energy minima We also explore options for improving the performance in these scenarios by transfer learning, either from models trained on a large database of mostly stable systems, or a different but related phase diagram. Models pretrained on stable materials do not significantly improve performance, but models trained on similar data transfer very well.

They affect your everyday life, for instance through recommendations on your streaming service and by informing decisions in healthcare, and are expected to have even more influence in society in the future. Among these machine learning models, we find neural networks which have had a wave of success within a wide range of fields in recent years. The success of neural networks are partly attributed to the very flexible model structure and, what it seems, endless possibilities in terms of extensions.</p><p>While neural networks come with great flexibility, they are so called black-box models and therefore offer little in terms of interpretability. In other words, it is seldom possible to explain or even understand why a neural network makes a certain decision. On top of this, these models are known to be overconfident, which means that they attribute low uncertainty to their predictions, even when uncertainty is, in reality, high. Previous work has demonstrated how this issue can be alleviated with the help of ensembles, i.e. by weighing the opinion of multiple models in prediction. In Paper I, we investigate this possibility further by creating a general framework for ensemble distribution distillation, developed for the purpose of preserving the performance benefits of ensembles while reducing computational costs. Specifically, we extend ensemble distribution distillation to make it applicable to tasks beyond classification and demonstrate the usefulness of the framework in, for example, out-of-distribution detection.</p><p>Another obstacle in the use of neural networks, especially deep neural networks, is that supervised training of these models can require a large amount of labelled data. The process of annotating a large amount of data is costly, time-consuming and also prone to errors. Specifically, there is a risk of incorporating label noise in the data. In Paper II, we investigate the effect of label noise on model performance. In particular, under an input-dependent noise model, we analyse the properties of the asymptotic risk minimisers of strictly proper and a set of previously proposed, robust loss functions. The results demonstrate that reliability, in terms of a model’s uncertainty estimates, is an important aspect to consider also in weak supervision and, particularly, when developing noise-robust training algorithms.</p><p>Related to annotation costs in supervised learning, is the use of active learning to optimise model performance under budget constraints. The goal of active learning, in this context, is to identify and annotate the observations that are most useful for the model’s performance. In Paper III, we propose an approach for taking advantage of intentionally weak annotations in active learning. What is proposed, more specifically, is to incorporate the possibility to collect cheaper, but noisy, annotations in the active learning algorithm. Thus, the same annotation budget is enough to annotate more data points for training. In turn, the model gets to explore a larger part of the input space. We demonstrate empirically how this can lead to gains in model performance.</p>;<p>Maskininlärningsmodeller används i flera delar av samhället, från autonoma fordon till rättssystem. De påverkar redan nu din vardag, exempelvis via personliga rekommendationer i din direktuppspelningstjänst (”streaming service”) och genom att agera beslutsstöd i vården, och förväntas ha än mer påverkan i samhället i framtiden. Bland dessa maskininlärningsmodeller, finner vi neurala nätverk som har haft stor framgång inom flera fält under det senaste årtiondet. Framgången beror delvis på neurala nätverks flexibla modellstruktur och, vad det verkar, oändliga utvecklingsmöjligheter.</p><p>Neurala nätverk erbjuder stor flexibilitet, men har en nackdel i att de är så kallade black-box-modeller. Detta innebär att det sällan går att förklara eller ens förstå varför ett neuralt nätverk tar ett visst beslut. Dessutom, så har den här typen av modeller en tendens att vara överdrivet självsäkra, vilket betyder att de rapporterar låg osäkerhet i sina beslut, även när osäkerheten i själva verket är hög. För ett självkörande fordon skulle detta till exempel kunna innebära att fordonet bedömer en vänstersväng som mycket säker, när sikten över det mötande körfältet är skymd och ett mötande fordon mycket väl kan finnas just bakom krönet. Tidigare forskning har demonstrerat hur denna typ av problem kan avhjälpas genom att använda flera neurala nätverk som samspelar för att prediktera eller ta ett beslut. På detta sätt fås en modell som är mer korrekt och som också är mer pålitlig när det kommer till att ge en uppskattning av den egna osäkerheten. I denna avhandling undersöker vi vidare hur vi kan lära ett enskilt neuralt nätverk att efterlikna flera samspelande modeller, för att minska de kostnader som kommer med att ha flera samspelande modeller i bruk.</p><p>En annan begränsande faktor när det kommer till neurala nätverk är att de kan behöva en stor mängd insamlad data med tillhörande etiketter för att lära sig den uppgift som de är ämnade för. Att införskaffa etiketter för en stor mängd datapunkter är både kostsamt och tidskrävande och det finns en risk att det blir fel i annoteringsprocessen. Mer specifikt så kan felaktiga etiketter, så kallat etikettbrus, inkluderas i datan. Detta i sin tur kan skada modellens förmåga att ta korrekta beslut. Vi undersöker hur denna effekt tar sig form och finner att etikettbrus inte bara kan ha en negativ effekt på nämnda förmåga att ta korrekta beslut, utan även på förmågan att skatta den egna osäkerheten.</p><p>Relaterat till annoteringskostnader, föreslår vi till sist ett tillvägagångssätt för att utnyttja brusiga etiketter i aktiv inlärning. Målet med aktiv inlärning, i denna kontext, är att identifiera och annotera de observationer som kommer att vara mest hjälpsamma i modellens inlärningprocess. Förslaget är att, i aktiv inlärning, ge möjligheten att samla in billigare, men brusiga, etiketter. På så sätt kan en begränsad annoteringsbudget räcka till att annotera fler datapunkter, vilket i sin tur kan leda till en bättre modell.

Traditional causal effect estimation methods such as Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) and more recently Regression-With-Residuals (RWR) are widely used - as they avoid the challenging task of identifying the SCM parameters - to estimate ACE and CACE. However, much work remains before traditional estimation methods can be used for counterfactual inference, and for the benefit of Personalized Public Policy Analysis (P3A) in the social sciences. While doctors rely on personalized medicine to tailor treatments to patients in laboratory settings (relatively closed systems), P3A draws inspiration from such tailoring but adapts it for open social systems. In this article, we develop a method for counterfactual inference that we name causal-Graphical Normalizing Flow (c-GNF), facilitating P3A. A major advantage of c-GNF is that it suits the open system in which P3A is conducted. First, we show how c-GNF captures the underlying SCM without making any assumption about functional forms. This capturing capability is enabled by the deep neural networks that model the underlying SCM via observational data likelihood maximization using gradient descent. Second, we propose a novel dequantization trick to deal with discrete variables, which is a limitation of normalizing flows in general. Third, we demonstrate in experiments that c-GNF performs on-par with IPW and RWR in terms of bias and variance for estimating the ACE, when the true functional forms are known, and better when they are unknown. Fourth and most importantly, we conduct counterfactual inference with c-GNFs, demonstrating promising empirical performance. Because IPW and RWR, like other traditional methods, lack the capability of counterfactual inference, c-GNFs will likely play a major role in tailoring personalized treatment, facilitating P3A, optimizing social interventions - in contrast to the current `one-size-fits-all' approach of existing methods.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","2022-08-03","2023-10-12","","","3","","deprecated","","publishedPaper","Thirty-Sixth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, (AAAI2022), Vancouver, Canada, Feb 22-March 1, 2022","","21437","true","","",""

Public transport users are particularly sensitive to unexpected waiting times, which negatively affect their perception on the system's reliability. In this paper we develop a robust model for real-time bus travel time prediction that departs from Gaussian assumptions by using Student-t errors. The proposed approach uses spatiotemporal characteristics from the route and previous bus trips to model short-term effects, and date/time variables and Gaussian processes for long-run forecasts. The model allows for flexible modeling of mean, variance and kurtosis spaces. We propose algorithms for Bayesian inference and for computing probabilistic forecast distributions. Experiments are performed using data from high-frequency buses in Stockholm, Sweden. Results show that Student-t models outperform Gaussian ones in terms of log-posterior predictive power to forecast bus delays at specific stops, which reveals the importance of accounting for predictive uncertainty in model selection. Estimated Student-t regressions capture typical temporal variability between within-day hours and different weekdays. Strong spatiotemporal effects are detected for incoming buses from immediately previous stops, which is in line with many recently developed models. We finally show how Bayesian inference naturally allows for predictive uncertainty quantification, e.g. by returning the predictive probability that the delay of an incoming bus exceeds a given threshold.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-17","2022-02-17","2023-03-06","","Vetenskapsrådet [2020-02846]","2","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-191153","","","","","true","","",""

When training a flexible discriminative model using a strictly proper loss,such noise will inevitably shift the solution towards the conditional distribution over noisylabels. Nevertheless, while deep neural networks have proven capable of fitting randomlabels, regularisation and the use of robustloss functions empirically mitigate the effectsof label noise. However, such observationsconcern robustness in accuracy, which is insufficient if reliable uncertainty quantificationis critical. We demonstrate this by analysingthe properties of the conditional distributionover noisy labels for an input-dependent noisemodel. In addition, we evaluate the set ofrobust loss functions characterised by noiseinsensitive, asymptotic risk minimisers. Wefind that strictly proper and robust loss functions both offer asymptotic robustness in accuracy, but neither guarantee that the finalmodel is calibrated. Moreover, even with robust loss functions, overfitting is an issue inpractice. With these results, we aim to explain observed robustness of common training practices, such as early stopping, to labelnoise. In addition, we aim to encourage thedevelopment of new noise-robust algorithmsthat not only preserve accuracy but that alsoensure reliability. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-22","2022-05-22","2023-04-03","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1659811/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","2","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-183965","publishedPaper","International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, ELECTR NETWORK, mar 28-30, 2022","","","false","","",""

We propose a flexible GMRF model for general graphs built on the multi-layer structure of Deep GMRFs, originally proposed for lattice graphs only. By designing a new type of layer we enable the model to scale to large graphs. The layer is constructed to allow for efficient training using variational inference and existing software frameworks for Graph Neural Networks. For a Gaussian likelihood, close to exact Bayesian inference is available for the latent field. This allows for making predictions with accompanying uncertainty estimates.

Ignoring the censoring can be problematic as valuable information may be missing and restoration of these censored values may significantly improve the quality of models. There are many scenarios where one may encounter censored data: survival data, interval-censored data or data with a lower limit of detection. Strategies to handle censored data are plenty, however, little effort has been made to handle censored data of high dimension. In this article, we present a selective multiple imputation approach for predictive modeling when a larger number of covariates are subject to censoring. Our method allows for iterative, subject-wise selection of covariates to impute in order to achieve a fast and accurate predictive model. The algorithm furthermore selects values for imputation which are likely to provide important information if imputed. In contrast to previously proposed methods, our approach is fully nonparametric and therefore, very flexible. We demonstrate that, in comparison to previous work, our model achieves faster execution and often comparable accuracy in a simulated example as well as predicting signal strength in radio network data. for this article are available online.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","2022-04-07","2023-03-06","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1650480/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","2","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-187763","","","","","false","","",""

The purpose of this study was to demonstrate validation of a multivariate feature-based LR method for SAILR using compositional data on glass fragments. Validation was performed using designated performance characteristics, e.g., accuracy, discrimination, and calibration. These characteristics were measured using performance metrics such as cost of the log likelihood ratio and equal error rate. The LR method was developed simultaneously to a baseline method having features less discriminating, but being better aligned with the normality assumption for within-source variation. The baseline method served as the floor of acceptable performance. The results showed that the available data supported LR methods using three elemental features or less. Best performance was obtained using calcium, magnesium, and silicon. The within-source variation in elemental features was slightly leptokurtic (heavy-tailed), violating the assumption of normality. The data were therefore normalized using Lambert W transformation and the performance of the LR method using normalized data was compared with that using non-normalized data. Although performance improved with normalization, the difference was small. Limits of LR output were set to 1/512 &amp;lt; LR &amp;lt; 158 using the empirical lower and upper boundaries (ELUB) LR method.

However, performing a successful AEC in large commercial vehicles has proved complicated due to the size and challenging variations in the acoustic characteristics of their cabins. Here, we present a wideband fully linear time domain NLMS algorithm for AEC that is enhanced by a statistical double-talk detector (DTD) and a voice activity detector (VAD). The proposed solution was tested in four main Volvo truck models, with various cabin geometries, using standard Swedish hearing-in-noise (HINT) sentences in the presence and absence of engine noise. The results show that the proposed solution achieves a high echo return loss enhancement (ERLE) of at least 25 dB with a fast convergence time, fulfilling ITU G.168 requirements. The presented solution was particularly developed to provide a practical compromise between accuracy and computational cost to allow its real-time implementation on commercial digital signal processors (DSPs). A real-time implementation of the solution was coded in C on an ARM Cortex M-7 DSP. The algorithmic latency was measured at less than 26 ms for processing each 50-ms buffer indicating the computational feasibility of the proposed solution for real-time implementation on common DSPs and embedded systems with limited computational and memory resources.

A key element in the cities’ infrastructure is the transportation system, as it facilitates the mobility of people and goods. Transportation systems are constantly generating data from, e.g., GPS, sensors and cameras, and the statistical modeling is challenging due to the complex structure and dynamics of the system, and the inherent uncertainty. In this thesis, we develop Bayesian models with applications to transportation. We specifically focus on models that can be trained on spatiotemporal data coming from transport networks to make predictions on, e.g., bus delays or the actual network topology. Special attention has been given to model scalability issues and uncertainty quantification. We have used real-world data from transportation systems in every study to keep a balance between statistical rigor, novelty, and applicability. </p><p>The thesis consists of four papers. The first study presents a state-of-the-art probabilistic latent network model to forecast multilayer dynamic graphs. The model uses stochastic blockmodeling to reduce the computational burden, and is illustrated on a sample of 10-year data from four major airlines within the US air transportation system. In the second paper, we develop a robust model for real-time bus travel time prediction that departs from Gaussian assumptions by using Student-t errors, and show how Bayesian inference naturally allows for predictive uncertainty quantification in a highly stochastic environment. Experiments are performed using data from high-frequency buses in Stockholm, Sweden. The third paper shows the potential of multi-output Gaussian processes to tackle network-wide travel time prediction in an urban area. We develop a responsive online model based on a coregionalized covariance and test its accuracy on real data from GPS-equipped taxis. Finally, we propose a novel regularization strategy for the vector autoregressive model that is based on a graphical spike-and-slab prior, and present a case study with real airline delay data to assess its predictive performance and analyze network patterns related to the propagation of delays across airports. </p>;<p>Urbaniseringen har orsakat en historisk förändring på en global skala, och mänskligheten går mot ett uppkopplat globalt nätverkssamhälle där städer kommer att koncentrera befolkning, infrastruktur och ekonomisk aktivitet.

Vi fokuserar specifikt på modeller som kan tränas på spatiotemporala data från transportnätverk för att göra prediktioner av t ex. bussförseningar eller verklig nätverkstopologi. Särskild uppmärksamhet har ägnats åt modellskalbarhetsfrågor och kvantifiering av osäkerhet. Vi har använt data från riktiga transportsystem i varje studie för att skapa en balans mellan statistisk korrekthet, praktiskt tillämpbarhet och vetenskaplig höjd. Avhandlingen består av fyra artiklar. Den första artikeln presenterar en probabilistisk latent nätverksmodell för att prognostisera dynamiska grafer med multipla lager. Modellen använder stokastisk blockmodellering för att minska beräkningsbördan, och illustreras på ett datamaterial bestånde av tio års data från fyra stora flygbolag inom det amerikanska lufttransportsystemet. I den andra artikeln utvecklar vi en robust modell för realtidsprognoser av bussförseningar genom att använda Student-t fördelning och vi visar hur Bayesiansk inferens ger en naturlig kvantifiering av osäkerhet i en mycket stokastisk miljö. Experiment utförs med hjälp av högfrekventa data från bussar i Stockholm. Den tredje artikeln visar potentialen hos fler-dimensionella Gaussiska processer för att generera nätverksövergripande prediktioner av trafikflöden i en tätortsmiljö. Vi utvecklar en responsiv onlinemodell baserad på en co-regionaliserad kovariansstruktur och utvärderar prognosförmåga på verkliga data från GPS-utrustade taxibilar. Slutligen föreslår vi en ny regularisering av den vektorautoregressiva modellen via en nätverksbaserad variabelsselektionsprior, och presenterar en fallstudie på verkliga data över förseningar i kommersiell flygtrafik där vi utvärderar prediktiv förmåga och analyserar nätverksmönster för hur förseningar sprids mellan flygplatser.  </p>","Susilo, Yusak, Professor","Villani, Mattias [matvi05], Professor (Linköpings universitet [276], Institutionen för datavetenskap [281], ;;;Statistik och maskininlärning [878151]) (Linköpings universitet [276], ;Filosofiska fakulteten [1750])Voltes-Dorta, Augusto [augvo89] (Linköpings universitet [276], Institutionen för datavetenskap [281], ;;;Statistik och maskininlärning [878151]) (Linköpings universitet [276], ;Filosofiska fakulteten [1750])","","","","","","","","Ada Lovelace, Building B, Campus Valla, Linköping","eng","2023-02-17T13:15","2023-01-20","2023-01-20","2023-02-15","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1729371/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","1","","deprecated","","","","","","true","true","",""

This is a common in econometrics where the marginal likelihood is often computed by Markov chain Monte Carlo or importance sampling methods. The new acquisition strategy gives the optimizer the option to explore the function with cheap noisy evaluations and therefore find the optimum faster.

Here, we investigated if another set of 2D projections, based on higher-order statistical central moments and eigenslices, leads to a higher accuracy.

Methods The data used in this study came from the first 9 waves of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, spanning 2002-2019. There were n = 76,014 observations (proportion male 45%). Dependent measures were verbal fluency, immediate recall, delayed recall, and orientation. Data were modeled using a Bayesian logistic growth curve model. Results Cognitive aging was substantial in 3 of the 4 variables examined. For verbal fluency and immediate recall, males and females could expect to lose about 30% of their initial ability between the ages of 52 and 89. Delayed recall showed a steeper decline, with males losing 40% and females losing 50% of their delayed recall ability between ages 52 and 89 (although females had a higher initial level of delayed recall). Orientation alone was not particularly affected by aging, with less than a 10% change for either males or females. Furthermore, we found cohort effects for initial ability level, with particularly steep increases for cohorts born between approximately 1930 and 1950. Discussion These cohort effects generally favored later-born cohorts. Implications and future directions are discussed.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023-08-24","2023-08-24","2023-08-24","","","8","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

To investigate if qMRI data provides additional information compared to cMRI sequences when considering deep learning-based brain tumor detection and segmentation, preoperative conventional (T1-w per- and post-contrast, T2-w and FLAIR) and quantitative (pre- and post-contrast R1, R2 and proton density) MR data was obtained from 23 patients with typical radiological findings suggestive of a high-grade malignant glioma. 2D deep learning models were trained on transversal slices (n=528) for tumor detection and segmentation using either conventional or quantitative data. Moreover, trends in quantitative R1 and R2 rates of regions identified as relevant for tumor detection by model explainability methods were qualitatively analyzed. Tumor detection and segmentation performance for models trained with a combination of qMRI pre- and post-contrast was the highest (detection MCC=0.72, segmentation DSC=0.90), however, the difference compared to cMRI was not statistically significant. Overall analysis of the relevant regions identified using model explainability showed no differences between models trained on cMRI or qMRI. When looking at the individual cases, relaxation rates of brain regions outside the annotation and identified as relevant for tumor detection exhibited changes after contrast injection similar to region inside the annotation in the majority of cases. In conclusion, models trained on qMRI data obtained similar detection and segmentation performance to those trained on cMRI data, with the advantage of quantitatively measuring brain tissue properties within similar scan time. When considering individual patients, the analysis of relaxation rates of regions identified by model explainability suggests the presence of infiltrative tumor outside the tumor cMRI-based annotation.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023-08-16","2023-08-16","2023-12-18","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1788219/FULLTEXT01.pdf","Vetenskapsrådet [2018-05250];Vinnova [ASSIST];Vinnova [IMPACT];Åke Wibergs Stiftelse [M22-0088];Forskningsrådet i Sydöstra Sverige, FORSS [FORSS-234551];Linköpings universitet [LiU Cancer Strength Area 2021]","4","","deprecated","","","","","035038","false","","",""

Using our approach, one training epoch with 20,324 subjects takes 20–50 s using a single GPU, which is two orders of magnitude faster than a small 3D CNN. This speedup is explained by the fact that 3D brain volumes contain a lot of redundant information, which can be efficiently compressed using 2D projections.

In this paper, we propose a method to improve the representations learned by deep neural image classifiers in spite of a shortcut in upstream data. In our method, the upstream classification objective is augmented with a type of adversarial training where an auxiliary network, so called lens, fools the classifier by exploiting the shortcut in reconstructing images.

Accompanying these data-driven methods with differentially-constrained motion models to provide physically feasible trajectories is a promising future direction. The foundation for this work is a previously introduced graph-neural-network-based model, MTP-GO. The neural network learns to compute the inputs to an underlying motion model to provide physically feasible trajectories. This research investigates the performance of various motion models in combination with numerical solvers for the prediction task. The study shows that simpler models, such as low-order integrator models, are preferred over more complex, e.g., kinematic models, to achieve accurate predictions.

However, it carries risks of various radiation toxicities, which can lead to functional deficits for the patients. Current inverse planning algorithms for SRS provide an efficient way for sparing organs at risk (OARs) by setting maximum radiation dose constraints in the treatment planning process.Purpose: We propose using activation maps from functional MRI (fMRI) to map the eloquent regions of the brain and define functional OARs (fOARs) for Gamma Knife SRS treatment planning.Methods: We implemented a pipeline for analyzing patient fMRI data, generating fOARs from the resulting activation maps, and loading them onto the GammaPlan treatment planning software. We used the Lightning inverse planner to generate multiple treatment plans from open MRI data of five subjects, and evaluated the effects of incorporating the proposed fOARs.Results: The Lightning optimizer designs treatment plans with high conformity to the specified parameters. Setting maximum dose constraints on fOARs successfully limits the radiation dose incident on them, but can have a negative impact on treatment plan quality metrics. By masking out fOAR voxels surrounding the tumor target it is possible to achieve high quality treatment plans while controlling the radiation dose on fOARs.Conclusions: The proposed method can effectively reduce the radiation dose incident on the eloquent brain areas during Gamma Knife SRS of brain tumors.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023-08-03","2023-08-03","2023-12-18","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1785636/FULLTEXT02.pdf","Vinnova [2018‐02230];Vinnova [2021‐01954]","3","","deprecated","","","","","","false","true","",""

AFFs are associated with drugs that are administered to prevent osteoporosis-related fragility fractures, which are highly prevalent in the elderly population. Given that these fractures are rare and the radiologic changes are subtle currently only 7% of AFFs are correctly identified, which hinders adequate treatment for most patients with AFF. Deep learning models could be trained to classify automatically a fracture as AFF or NFF, thereby assisting radiologists in detecting these rare fractures. Historically, for this classification task, only imaging data have been used, using convolutional neural networks (CNN) or vision transformers applied to radiographs. However, to mimic situations in which all available data are used to arrive at a diagnosis, we adopted an approach of deep learning that is based on the integration of image data and tabular data (from electronic health records) for 159 patients with AFF and 914 patients with NFF. We hypothesized that the combinatorial data, compiled from all the radiology departments of 72 hospitals in Sweden and the Swedish National Patient Register, would improve classification accuracy, as compared to using only one modality. At the patient level, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) increased from 0.966 to 0.987 when using the integrated set of imaging data and seven pre-selected variables, as compared to only using imaging data. More importantly, the sensitivity increased from 0.796 to 0.903. We found a greater impact of data fusion when only a randomly selected subset of available images was used to make the image and tabular data more balanced for each patient. The AUC then increased from 0.949 to 0.984, and the sensitivity increased from 0.727 to 0.849.</p><p>These AUC improvements are not large, mainly because of the already excellent performance of the CNN (AUC of 0.966) when only images are used. However, the improvement is clinically highly relevant considering the importance of accuracy in medical diagnostics. We expect an even greater effect when imaging data from a clinical workflow, comprising a more diverse set of diagnostic images, are used.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023-11-15","2023-11-15","2024-01-17","","Vinnova [2021-01954];Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse;Vetenskapsrådet [2023-01942]","4","","deprecated","","","","","107704","true","true","",""

In parametric t-SNE, a neural network learns to reproduce this mapping. When used for EEG analysis, the data are usually first transformed into a set of features, but it is not known which features are optimal. The principle of t-SNE was used to train convolutional neural network (CNN) encoders to learn to produce both a high- and a low-dimensional representation, eliminating the need for feature engineering. To evaluate the method, the Temple University EEG Corpus was used to create three datasets with distinct EEG characters: (1) wakefulness and sleep; (2) interictal epileptiform discharges; and (3) seizure activity. The CNN encoders produced low-dimensional representations of the datasets with a structure that conformed well to the EEG characters and generalized to new data. Compared to parametric t-SNE for either a short-time Fourier transform or wavelet representation of the datasets, the developed CNN encoders performed equally well in separating categories, as assessed by support vector machines. The CNN encoders generally produced a higher degree of clustering, both visually and in the number of clusters detected by k-means clustering. The developed principle is promising and could be further developed to create general tools for exploring relations in EEG data.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023-03-07","2023-03-07","2023-04-18","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1741929/FULLTEXT02.pdf","Vinnova [2021-01954];Region Östergötland [LIO-936176 and RÖ-941359];Linköpings universitet","4","","deprecated","","","","","453","false","true","",""

The samples were from a biobank associated with the All Babies in Southeast Sweden (ABIS) registry. We proposed a Bayesian multivariate log-normal model for partially censored values to identify potentially relevant metals for the etiology of ASD. Our results in cord blood suggest prenatal Al levels could be indicative of later ASD incidence, which could also be related to an increased possibility of a high, potentially toxic, exposure to Al and Li during pregnancy. In addition, a larger possibility of a high, potentially beneficial, exposure to Zn could occur during pregnancy in controls.

The focus of the paper is on the latter requirement, and we use decision theory to develop a model for sufficient informativeness. We demonstrate that sufficient informativeness is fundamentally a question of information economics and switch-ability. In our model, sufficient informativeness is a cost-benefit-analysis of further investigations that involves a prediction of the possibility that such investigations will produce evidence that switches the decision from conviction to acquittal. Critics of the Bayesian approach to legal evidence have claimed that weight cannot be captured in a Bayesian model. Contrary to this claim, our model shows how sufficient informativeness can be modelled as a second order probability.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023-04-05","2023-04-05","2023-06-22","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1749126/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","2","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

Children in families where the first child was born later had higher average PIAT math, reading recognition, and reading comprehension scores, as well as larger developmental growth.

Nevertheless, it is an invaluable source of information that should support classification of samples with such data, despite their low frequency. Current solutions considering the rarity information involve likelihood ratio models (LR). We intend to modify the existing LR models to establish the class membership for the analysed samples by comparing them with the samples of known class label. If two compared samples show similarities of rare but class-specific features it makes the analysed sample much more likely to be a member of this class than any other class, even when its features are less distant to the features of most samples from other classes. The fundamental advantage of the developed methodology is inclusion of information about rare, class-specific features, which is neglected by ordinary classifiers. Converting LR values into probabilities with which a sample belongs to the classes under consideration, generates a powerful tool within the concept of probabilistic classification.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023-08-24","2023-08-24","2024-01-11","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1791081/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","2","","deprecated","","","","","104862","false","","",""

We also perform simulations to determine if it is possible to distinguish between various adaptive hypotheses. We find that Akaikes information criterion corrected for small sample size has the ability to distinguish between most pairs of considered models. However, in some cases there seems to be bias towards Brownian motion or simpler Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models. We also find that measurement error and forcing the sign of the diagonal of the drift matrix for an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process influences identifiability capabilities. It is a cliche that some models, despite being imperfect, are more useful than others. Nonetheless, having a much larger repertoire of models will surely lead to a better understanding of the natural world, as it will allow for dissecting in what ways they are wrong.

Conventional brain MRI of these patients shows unspecific patterns, with no clear connection of the symptomatology to brain tissue abnormalities, whereas diffusion tensor studies and volumetric analyses detect measurable changes in the brain after COVID-19. Diffusion MRI exploits the random motion of water molecules to achieve unique sensitivity to structures at the microscopic level, and new sequences employing generalized diffusion encoding provide structural information which are sensitive to intravoxel features. In this observational study, a total of 32 persons were investigated: 16 patients previously hospitalized for COVID-19 with persisting symptoms of post-COVID condition (mean age 60 years: range 41–79, all male) at 7-month follow-up and 16 matched controls, not previously hospitalized for COVID-19, with no post-COVID symptoms (mean age 58 years, range 46–69, 11 males). Standard MRI and generalized diffusion encoding MRI were employed to examine the brain white matter of the subjects. To detect possible group differences, several tissue microstructure descriptors obtainable with the employed diffusion sequence, the fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, microscopic anisotropy, orientational coherence (Cc) and variance in compartment’s size (CMD) were analysed using the tract-based spatial statistics framework. The tract-based spatial statistics analysis showed widespread statistically significant differences (P &lt; 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons using the familywise error rate) in all the considered metrics in the white matter of the patients compared to the controls. Fractional anisotropy, microscopic anisotropy and Cc were lower in the patient group, while axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, mean diffusivity and CMD were higher. Significant changes in fractional anisotropy, microscopic anisotropy and CMD affected approximately half of the analysed white matter voxels located across all brain lobes, while changes in Cc were mainly found in the occipital parts of the brain. Given the predominant alteration in microscopic anisotropy compared to Cc, the observed changes in diffusion anisotropy are mostly due to loss of local anisotropy, possibly connected to axonal damage, rather than white matter fibre coherence disruption. The increase in radial diffusivity is indicative of demyelination, while the changes in mean diffusivity and CMD are compatible with vasogenic oedema. In summary, these widespread alterations of white matter microstructure are indicative of vasogenic oedema, demyelination and axonal damage. These changes might be a contributing factor to the diversity of central nervous system symptoms that many patients experience after COVID-19.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023-11-19","2023-11-19","2024-01-03","","Vinnova [2021-01954];Wallenbergstiftelserna","6","","deprecated","urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-199898","","","","fcad284","true","true","",""

In this study, we present a new metagenetic method for detecting the co-occurrence of different Wolbachia strains in freshwater invertebrates host species, i.e., freshwater Arthropoda (Crustacea), Mollusca (Bivalvia), and water bears (Tardigrada) by applying NGS primers designed by us and a Python script that allows the identification of Wolbachia target sequences from the microbiome communities. We also compare the results obtained using the commonly applied NGS primers and the Sanger sequencing approach.

Most research has focused on Flynns main finding: IQ scores have increased over time. Flynn (1987) presumed the effect was a cohort (generational) effect, yet a variety of within-and between-person processes could give rise to the observed secular changes. Many theories have been put forth as to the fundamental cause of the Flynn effect. Frequently ignored is what a specific cause implies the Flynn effect would look like at different levels of analysis and in the context of different research designs. In this paper we present two lenses with which to view a potential causal model of the Flynn effect, in the hopes of closing some of the current gaps emerging from past research. First, we propose an examination of within-versus between-person processes. Relatedly, we propose that the exclusive focus on normed measures of intelligence has hampered understanding of what functional form the Flynn effect might take, particularly during development. Consideration of ""raw"" intelligence is likely to be fruitful. For our second lens, we consider the framework of age-period-cohort modeling to categorize what kind of effect a given model implies. We examine several causal theories of the Flynn effect through these lenses. Viewed through our lenses, we find that certain causal theories are, perhaps, somewhat incomplete in their specification of all the relevant processes.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023-05-05","2023-05-05","2023-06-02","","","3","","deprecated","","","","","101735","false","","",""

In many applications, such models will give reasonable approximations. However, they will often be found not to be entirely correct when enough data are at hand. A property of classical optimal design methodology is that the amount of data does not influence the design when a fixed model is used. However, it is reasonable that a low dimensional model is satisfactory only if limited data is available. With more data available, more aspects of the underlying relationship can be assessed. We consider a simple model that is not thought to be fully correct. The model misspecification, that is, the difference between the true mean and the simple model, is explicitly modeled with a stochastic process. This gives a unified approach to handle situations with both limited and rich data. Our objective is to estimate the combined model, which is the sum of the simple model and the assumed misspecification process. In our situation, the low-dimensional model can be viewed as a fixed effect and the misspecification term as a random effect in a mixed-effects model. Our aim is to predict within this model. We describe how we minimize the prediction error using an optimal design. We compute optimal designs for the full model in different cases. The results confirm that the optimal design depends strongly on the sample size. In low-information situations, traditional optimal designs for models with a small number of parameters are sufficient, while the inclusion of the misspecification term lead to very different designs in data-rich cases.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023-03-14","2023-03-14","2023-04-06","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1743308/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","3","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

Our TGNN4I model is designed to handle both irregular time steps and partial observations of the graph. This is achieved by introducing a time-continuous latent state in each node, following a linear Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) defined by the output of a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The ODE has an explicit solution as a combination of exponential decay and periodic dynamics. Observations in the graph neighborhood are taken into account by integrating graph neural network layers in both the GRU state update and predictive model. The time-continuous dynamics additionally enable the model to make predictions at arbitrary time steps. We propose a loss function that leverages this and allows for training the model for forecasting over different time horizons. Experiments on simulated data and real-world data from traffic and climate modeling validate the usefulness of both the graph structure and time-continuous dynamics in settings with irregular observations. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023-05-12","2023-05-12","2023-05-16","","ELLIIT - The Linköping‐Lund Initiative on IT and Mobile Communications;Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP);Vetenskapsrådet [2020-04122]","3","","deprecated","","publishedPaper","The 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS), Valencia, Spain, 2023","","","true","","",""

We derive a test of the bilateral linear hypothesis on the mean matrix in a general scenario where the dimensions of the observed vector may exceed the sample size, design may be unbalanced, the population distribution may be non-normal and the underlying group covariance matrices may be unequal. The suggested methodology is suitable for many inferential problems, such as the one-way MANOVA test and the test for multivariate linear hypothesis on the mean in the polynomial growth curve model. As a key component of our test procedure, we propose a bias-corrected estimator of the Frobenius norm of the mean matrix. We derive null and non-null asymptotic distributions of the test statistic under a general high-dimensional asymptotic framework that allows the dimensionality to arbitrarily exceed the sample size of a group. The accuracy of the proposed test in a finite sample setting is investigated through simulations conducted for several high-dimensional scenarios and various underlying population distributions in combination with different within-group covariance structures. For a practical demonstration we consider a daily Canadian temperature dataset that exhibits group structure, and conclude that the interaction of latitude and longitude has no effect to predict the temperature.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023-11-07","2023-11-07","2023-11-07","","","4","","deprecated","","","","","","false","","",""

An outdoor office was set up in the courtyard of a university campus, and the participants (n = 16) conducted office work outdoors for 30 min and thereafter participated in an eye-tracking session for 11-15 min (n = 8) and subsequently filled out surveys (n = 16).

The results indicate that outdoor office work in a public urban space may promote work-related well-being in terms of positive outdoor office space experiences. Based on the findings, a preliminary set of outdoor office qualities is proposed.

A gradual decline in cardiorespiratory fitness among adults, along with increased rate of non-communicable diseases across developed countries, makes the workplace an important opportunity for promoting healthy behaviors. This study aimed to investigate: how office companies in Sweden organize and provide workplace health promotion services related to physical activity; the companies vision for providing workplace health promotion; and potential facilitators and barriers. Nine informants from eight companies participated in the study, and both qualitative and quantitative data were collected by semi-structured interviews. Informants were selected through purposive sampling in collaboration with eight companies in the office market, including companies that own and develop office buildings, shared workspaces, interior design, sustainable solutions, or consult on issues related to the office sector. The framework method was used to analyze the data in a flexible and systematic way. The results showed that workplace health promotion is implemented to maintain employee health, productivity, and employee branding. Also, a significant number of financial resources, organizational support and office space are devoted to workplace health promotion. Convenience and easy access to storage and fitness facilities are key facilitators. In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of employees engagement in developing and improving workplace health promotion and addressing work-life balance constraints that hinder a healthy lifestyle. Removing barriers on an organizational level may improve the usage of workplace health promotion related to physical activity among office employees.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023-05-31","2023-05-31","2023-10-17","https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1760930/FULLTEXT01.pdf","","4","","deprecated","","","","","1175977","false","true","",""

In a recent contribution, scholars showed that normalizing flows carry certain properties, making them particularly suitable for causal and counterfactual analysis. However, c-GNFs have only been tested in a simulated data setting and no contribution to date have evaluated the application of c-GNFs on large-scale real-world data. Focusing on the \emph{AI for social good}, our study provides a counterfactual analysis of the impact of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program on child poverty using c-GNFs. The analysis relies on a large-scale real-world observational data: 1,941,734 children under the age of 18, cared for by 567,344 families residing in the 67 countries from the Global-South. While the primary objective of the IMF is to support governments in achieving economic stability, our results find that an IMF program reduces child poverty as a positive side-effect by about 1.2±0.24 degree (`0' equals no poverty and `7' is maximum poverty). Thus, our article shows how c-GNFs further the use of deep learning and causal inference in AI for social good. It shows how learning algorithms can be used for addressing the untapped potential for a significant social impact through counterfactual inference at population level (ACE), sub-population level (CACE), and individual level (ICE). In contrast to most works that model ACE or CACE but not ICE, c-GNFs enable personalization using \emph{`The First Law of Causal Inference'}.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","2022-10-04","2022-10-13","","Vetenskapsrådet","3","","deprecated","","","","","","true","","",""

Although directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are increasingly used to represent these theories, their full potential has not yet been realized in practice. As non-parametric causal models, DAGs require no assumptions about the functional form of the hypothesized relationships. Nevertheless, to simplify the task of empirical evaluation, researchers tend to invoke such assumptions anyway, even though they are typically arbitrary and do not reflect any theoretical content or prior knowledge. Moreover, functional form assumptions can engender bias, whenever they fail to accurately capture the complexity of the causal system under investigation. In this article, we introduce causal-graphical normalizing flows (cGNFs), a novel approach to causal inference that leverages deep neural networks to empirically evaluate theories represented as DAGs. Unlike conventional approaches, cGNFs model the full joint distribution of the data according to a DAG supplied by the analyst, without relying on stringent assumptions about functional form. In this way, the method allows for flexible, semi-parametric estimation of any causal estimand that can be identified from the DAG, including total effects, conditional effects, direct and indirect effects, and path-specific effects. We illustrate the method with a reanalysis of Blau and Duncan’s (1967) model of status attainment and Zhou’s (2019) model of conditional versus controlled mobility. To facilitate adoption, we provide open-source software together with a series of online tutorials for implementing cGNFs. The article concludes with a discussion of current limitations and directions for future development.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2024-01-13","2024-01-13","2024-01-25","","Vetenskapsrådet","5","","deprecated","","","","","","true","","",""

We refer to the new model as ρ-GNF (ρ-Graphical Normalizing Flow), where ρ∈[−1,+1] is a bounded sensitivity parameter representing the backdoor non-causal association due to unobserved confounding modeled using the most well studied and widely popular Gaussian copula. Specifically, ρ-GNF enables us to estimate and analyse the frontdoor causal effect or average causal effect (ACE) as a function of ρ. We call this the ρcurve. The ρcurve enables us to specify the confounding strength required to nullify the ACE. We call this the ρvalue. Further, the ρcurve also enables us to provide bounds for the ACE given an interval of ρ values. We illustrate the benefits of ρ-GNF with experiments on simulated and real-world data in terms of our empirical ACE bounds being narrower than other popular ACE bounds.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-04","2022-10-04","2022-10-13","","Vetenskapsrådet","3","","deprecated","","","","","","true","","",""
